1
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:03,168
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,401
There's something about this guy.

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,563
He knows where we're going,
what we're thinking.

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:11,040
It's a matter of time before he finds
out about the money in Utah...

5
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:14,374
...and our way into Mexico, everything.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,154
You can have an attorney
present during questioning.

7
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:26,451
Caroline, they're taking her in.
Of course. I'll keep an eye on her.

8
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,287
I did it, Dad.

9
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:29,928
Just do as you're told.

10
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:33,862
Otherwise, there will be
consequences that will affect us all.

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,695
My dad's an Air Force colonel.

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:41,398
When I told him I was staying in a hotel
with a guy that I maybe sort of liked...

13
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,637
...he lost it.

14
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,272
What're you doing here? Where's Maricruz?
- She's with me.

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,706
Just tell me where she is.
- Hey, Fernando, slow down, man.

16
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,444
I was trying to tell you
the wedding is in Vegas.

17
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:58,088
So which one of them it was it?
- Might be scofield.

18
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,249
Probably gonna find his
brother in there too.

19
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:05,260
Where to, sir?
- Utah.

20
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,368
This morning, authorities in Illinois issued
an update on the escaped convicts,,,

21
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,239
,,, known, until now,
as the Fox River Eight,

22
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,277
chicago mob boss John Abruzzi,,,

23
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:24,542
,,, was gunned down outside a
Washington, D, c, motel last night,,,

24
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:27,686
,,, after investigators received
a tip from an informant,

25
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:31,654
The other seven escapees are still
at large and considered dangerous,

26
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:33,753
A Florida man wanted in...

27
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,456
I didn't think Abruzzi'd be the first to eat it.

28
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,296
I have a feeling we're in for lots of surprises.

29
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:45,627
They said seven are still out there.
So much for faking our deaths.

30
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,501
I bought us some time.
That's what counts.

31
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,744
How much further?
- Seventy, 80 miles.

32
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,575
Means we should be hitting
Double-K Ranch by this afternoon.

33
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,013
We could keep driving,
pick up L.J. And hit Panama.

34
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:03,144
We can't hit Panama. We can't hit anything.
We can't do anything without the money.

35
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:06,554
We need to find Charles' stash.

36
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,786
I know some other guys who
are thinking the same thing.

37
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:18,704
The money is buried under a
silo at the Double-K Ranch...

38
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:24,367
...just outside of Tooele, Utah.
There's $5 million there.

39
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,155
Tickets.

40
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:46,893
You know, when I was in Cheyenne,
I pulled my ticket out of the bag.

41
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,896
It tore in half, and I have no idea
what happened to the other part.

42
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,936
They didn't issue you a replacement?
- No.

43
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,166
The young lady,
I think her name was sherry...

44
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,675
...she actually said that this half was
okay because the barcode was on it.

45
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,711
Well, you really need the whole ticket.

46
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,744
This is exactly what I was trying to avoid.

47
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,783
She said everything
would be fine because...

48
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,318
That's okay.
It'll do for now.

49
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,582
But make sure you ask for a
replacement when you get to Provo.

50
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,283
I definitely will.
Thank you.

51
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,222
It's always something, huh?
- Oh, God, I know.

52
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,174
I don't wanna go home.

53
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,608
I wish we could keep driving.

54
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,808
I don't think your pops will be down for that.

55
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,476
Wouldn't it be fun?

56
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:46,014
We could go to Hawaii.

57
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,628
No, you can't drive to Hawaii.
- I know.

58
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,127
I know.

59
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,891
I'm just saying,
I wish.

60
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,898
No, don't get it. They'll leave.
- Just let me see who it is.

61
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,610
It's a cop.

62
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,510
No, no, no.

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,515
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.
Have you happened to see this person?

64
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,791
Last night, we got a few phone calls
that he was spotted in the area.

65
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,192
So we're going door to door.

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,067
Why are you looking for him?

67
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,795
He escaped from prison in
Illinois a couple of days ago.

68
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,765
Have you seen him?

69
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,135
No.

70
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,871
He doesn't look familiar.

71
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,415
Are you sure?

72
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,512
Yeah, I'm sure.

73
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,681
All right.
Thanks for your time.

74
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,232
This ain't...
This is not what you think, all right?

75
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:42,068
Look, trust me.
Just listen, okay?

76
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:48,577
All I did was steal a baseball card, okay?
I'm not like those other fools up in there.

77
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,986
I'm gonna go for a walk, okay?

78
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,178
I'm gonna leave my keys right here.

79
00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:00,288
And when I come back,
my car will be gone.

80
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:06,655
I'm sure in a few hours,
they'll find it somewhere...

81
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,599
...abandoned.

82
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,106
Wait, wait.

83
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,881
I wish it could be different.

84
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,546
I have to go.

85
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:50,007
Tooele.
- I think it's "Tooele."

86
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,667
Hell of a town.
- Small is good.

87
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,574
Means the ranch'll be easier to find.

88
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,977
All we gotta do is get that money...

89
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,483
...and be out of here by nightfall.
- Nice.

90
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,103
Oh, sir.
Soil tests came back from scofield's crash.

91
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,111
Not that you need any more proof,
but he really went out of his way this time.

92
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,272
What else do you have?

93
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,477
A man was assaulted in Nebraska by a
hitchhiker matching Bagwell's description.

94
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:38,112
He was headed west on the I-80.
Omaha's putting together a photo lineup.

95
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,849
What do you have on scofield?

96
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,018
What does anybody have on scofield?

97
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,698
I've got some results from his hard drive.
The one recovered from the river.

98
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:54,337
We were able to use the sector editor to
restore the master boot. So from that...

99
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,668
I don't care how you did it.
What do you have?

100
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,508
More than half the contents of the buffer.
About 60 percent.

101
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,546
It looks pretty random.
- Print it up, all of it. I want it on my desk.

102
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,755
Well, guess what.

103
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,062
No listing for a Double-K Ranch.

104
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,892
Excuse me. You know where I
might find the Double-K Ranch?

105
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,504
What'd you call it?
- Double-K Ranch.

106
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,670
No.
- You from around here?

107
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,274
Yeah.
Born and raised.

108
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,200
There's no double nothing.

109
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,608
Great.
Thank you.

110
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,449
Looks like Westmoreland spent his last
breath blowing smoke up your ass.

111
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,916
There's one way to find out.

112
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,745
The county keeps property records.

113
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:47,552
Every plot is mapped out with dimensions.
It's public record.

114
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,458
But if there is a tax assessor's office here...

115
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,565
...it's gonna be in there.

116
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,031
In the municipal building.

117
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,362
Lot of cops in there, Michael.

118
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,909
Dispatch,
- Someone,,,,

119
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,673
Someone stole my car this morning,
I'm at the Lotus Motel off Interstate 80,

120
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:14,117
Did you see who took it?
- No, I went out for a walk,

121
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:18,314
And when I came back, it was gone,
- This morning? Why didn't you call before?

122
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,892
I don't know,

123
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,010
Mr. Kellerman.
- Mr. Kim.

124
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,856
Surprised to see you in Chicago.
- Just looking for updates.

125
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,492
Sara Tancredi.
I'm on it.

126
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,724
Is pursuing her the best use of your time?
- It is.

127
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:35,333
She's in contact with scofield.
I was there when he called yesterday.

128
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,732
We stay with her, she takes us right to him,
he takes us to Burrows.

129
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,872
All right.

130
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,804
Lf you're that confident.
- I am.

131
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:49,144
I'll let the president know.
- I contact the president directly.

132
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,415
I'll contact her.

133
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,749
Keep me posted.

134
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,776
If you wanna restore dignity,
you need to take action,

135
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,246
Making amends requires much
more than saying, "I'm sorry,"

136
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,781
It means learning to change.

137
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,549
The apology's just the first step.

138
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:38,185
The most important thing is
that you display honesty...

139
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:43,131
...courage and compassión
when you extend your apologies.

140
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,271
You need to earn your forgiveness.

141
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,401
We'll talk about it more on Friday.

142
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,983
I got a great idea.
- What's that?

143
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:09,855
Since you are such a fan of lame,
store-bought blueberry pie...

144
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:14,295
...I'm gonna bake you a real
pie of your choice tonight.

145
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,097
I can't.

146
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,970
I really don't need to be seeing anyone
right now who isn't my therapist.

147
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,309
I've been a hermit lately too.

148
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,275
My partner Daniel's away on business.

149
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,508
I've been sitting around
every night by myself.

150
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,443
Kind of pathetic.

151
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,687
I'm so sorry.
I thought you meant...

152
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,421
I thought...

153
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,192
The pie...
- oh, no.

154
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,302
No, I was really talking about...
- Pie?

155
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,906
Yeah, actual blueberries. Like we'd make
pie and watch Fried Green Tomatoes.

156
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,635
I get it. I get it.
- I'm the best ex-junkie cook in this town.

157
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,279
Thank you. I just...
I gotta clean my apartment.

158
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,847
It's disgusting.
I realize that sounds like an excuse.

159
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,984
It's not.
- No, no, no, I get it.

160
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,552
You do what you gotta do.

161
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,019
Have a good night.

162
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,254
You deliver?

163
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,266
Next batch.

164
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,663
Just put it on the desk.

165
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,870
Any of this stuff mean anything?
- I don't know. Ask me later.

166
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,374
Is he a genius or a whack job?

167
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,671
We answered that when
we assigned 100 agents.

168
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,838
So why don't you go get me the rest of it?

169
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,414
Does that work for you?

170
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,350
Alackaday.

171
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,748
I just found me an in-betweener.

172
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,923
Where you going in such a hurry?
- None of your beeswax, yo.

173
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,321
I know where.

174
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,486
The same place as every other man
that was in that room that night.

175
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:03,727
They all coming around here for a big
family reunion at the Ku Klux Ranch.

176
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,167
If they ain't here already.

177
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:09,364
There ain't no fool in this town
ever heard of the Double-K Ranch.

178
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,009
It seems like you been misinformed.
There is a Double-K.

179
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:16,136
It's just a matter of who gets there first.
The stars are gonna collide in Tooele.

180
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,249
You'll need me on your side.

181
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,151
This ain't Fox River,
all right? I don't need any...

182
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,387
As you can see...

183
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,185
...I need you.

184
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:33,127
Get your grubby paws off me,
you freak.

185
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,358
I ain't your ditch digger.

186
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,365
I don't need nothing from you.

187
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,935
I don't need nothing.

188
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:40,838
You might.

189
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:45,306
If a man knew where he was
supposed to be looking...

190
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,391
Hi,

191
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,222
Are you having the Hector Avila and
Maricruz Delgado wedding today?

192
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,866
Avila. No?
Thanks.

193
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,870
Hi. Are you having the Hector Avila
and Maricruz Delgado wedding today?

194
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,379
Avila.

195
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,212
Delgado.

196
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,908
Really?

197
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,450
When?

198
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,661
Stay calm.
We'll be out of here in 10 minutes.

199
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,765
One at a time.

200
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,168
Clear.
Back up.

201
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,775
You wearing a watch?

202
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,408
Yeah.

203
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,591
Nice day.

204
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,192
Thanks.

205
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:28,078
This is exactly what we need.
It's a map of every parcel of land.

206
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,410
Topography, buildings, everything.

207
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,212
Karl Kokosing.
Double-K.

208
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,119
I don't like the way this guy's looking at us.

209
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,260
Twelve-thirteen.

210
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,797
Where's 1213?

211
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:06,345
Hey, seifert. I need to speak with you.
- Come on, man. We gotta roll now.

212
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,788
Hey, seifert.
- Come on. You got the map?

213
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,926
No.

214
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,458
Someone else does.

215
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,904
Someone got here before us.
It's the only explanation.

216
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,778
Son of a bitch is still alive.

217
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:46,119
Hey, pretty.
- What the...?

218
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,755
What you gonna do, scream?

219
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,390
How the hell are you still breathing?

220
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,493
What the hell'd you do to your hand?

221
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,027
Easy, easy.

222
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,967
I recently had some work done.

223
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,898
Where's the map?

224
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:07,535
Easy, easy, easy.
I don't have it.

225
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,682
Well, where is it?
- I'm telling you, I don't have it.

226
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,347
Don't have it, huh?
- You were there. We saw you.

227
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,080
It was gone. Why don't you keep
your pooch away from me?

228
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,417
I'll tell you everything I know.

229
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,824
It's the kid.
He has it.

230
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,022
I saw him this morning.

231
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,032
I needed some help.
We made a deal, all right?

232
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,729
He said that he would dig.
I told him where we could get a map at.

233
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,033
What kid?

234
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:38,840
What kid?

235
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,452
The best thing to do is nothing.

236
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,561
That's how I'll get the U.s. Senate
to confirm my vice-presidency?

237
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,697
Do nothing?
- Shows them you can do the job.

238
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,797
Wait a minute.
It's my daughter.

239
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,536
Sir, we need to talk about your daughter.

240
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,201
What about her?

241
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,002
Well, the media is all over
this Fox River situation.

242
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,510
We think it would be best if you
could distance yourself from her...

243
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:19,208
If I hear this one more time...
I paid her bail. I walked away.

244
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,615
I have distanced myself.

245
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,091
Give me a minute.

246
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,959
Hey, Dad,
it's me.

247
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,827
When you get a chance, I really need
to talk to you about some things.

248
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,263
Actually, a lot of things.

249
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,305
The most important one is that...

250
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,173
...I owe you an apology.

251
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,905
I realize that I've made
things difficult for you lately.

252
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,952
And I wanna take responsibility for that.

253
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,788
Call me back.
Bye.

254
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:04,153
Hi. I know I'm early, but I brought dinner.
- Come on in.

255
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,922
You're not a vegetarian, are you?
- No.

256
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,192
Just shut that behind you.

257
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,904
Do you mind if I check my e-mail?
- No, not at all. Here.

258
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,379
Oh, you're so kind. Thank you.
- Absolutely.

259
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,872
Do you happen to have a pen handy?
- Yeah.

260
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,237
Thank you so much.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

261
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:58,406
No, look, I have a little pencil and pad.
- Thank you.

262
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,890
Sir. Sir.
- Yeah?

263
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,493
No sherry in Cheyenne.

264
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,823
Your ticket is not valid for travel.

265
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,330
Oh, well, hold on, now.
That can't be right. That can't be right.

266
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,559
Excuse me for a second.
- Sure.

267
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,738
All right, now, listen, brother,
I'm gonna give it to you straight up.

268
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,739
Seriously, I don't...
I'm broke, okay?

269
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,741
Now, that's the truth.

270
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,445
Now, I just ran into some
trouble a while back.

271
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,348
I'm just trying to pull it all together now.
You understand?

272
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,420
Well, you can tell that to the
authorities in about five minutes.

273
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:40,114
Come on, brother,
we don't have to get the authorities...

274
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,782
It's too late.

275
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,894
They're already waiting at the next stop.

276
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,395
These guys here are gonna
sit with you until we stop.

277
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,434
I understand.
I understand.

278
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:01,511
Hey!
- Come here.

279
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,647
Sir.
- Hey, you can't go in there.

280
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,385
Oh, my goodness.

281
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,664
Okay, we've got a confirmed
sighting on Franklin.

282
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,433
He jumped out of a moving
train in Preston, Idaho.

283
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:35,510
What is a black man from Chicago
doing in Idaho? He's gotta be lost.

284
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,705
Franklin's in Preston,
Bagwell's in Nebraska.

285
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,113
Both men have never been
across the Mississippi.

286
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,480
Visiting friends and family?
I don't think so.

287
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:45,145
And not south of the border.

288
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:50,693
They're due west,
and we need to know why.

289
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,288
Out.

290
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,802
What's going on?
- Where'd you say Tweener was headed?

291
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,700
Up on the main drag.
He's supposed to find a shovel.

292
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,838
In.
- No.

293
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,506
No, no, no.
- In.

294
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,051
You're coming back, right?
You're coming back?

295
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,126
Yep.
- Hey, you guys.

296
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,653
Hey.

297
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,598
Come on, man.
I'm boiling up in here.

298
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,478
I was on my ATV and I was hauling ass.
I was right on her tail.

299
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,946
I pulled out my gun and...
that bitch treed herself.

300
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,880
And I brought her down in one shot.

301
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,248
What'd she weigh?
- At least a hunny.

302
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,617
Maybe 110.
- Come on out and see us if you want.

303
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:56,227
It's gonna be a good time.
- Yeah, I just might do that.

304
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,696
Hey, now.
What you digging?

305
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,105
Some stuff in my grandpa's yard.

306
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,778
I got a bigger one in the
back if you're going deep.

307
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,176
No, this'll do.

308
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,744
Damn it if I don't know
you from somewhere.

309
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,448
Maybe I know your grandpa.

310
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,887
Doubt it, man.
He moved here like a month ago so...

311
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,923
What's his name?

312
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:33,563
His name's Grandpa, all right?
Can you just ring this up?

313
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,565
I gotta get out of here.
- Sure thing, fella.

314
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:37,963
I'll ring it up.

315
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,468
I'll ring it right now.

316
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,569
I know where I've seen you.
On TV.

317
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,269
You're one of them Fox River boys.

318
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:14,265
You got it wrong, man.
- No, I think I got it right.

319
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,835
We're closed.

320
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,049
Sorry, bud.

321
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,546
We're closing up early today.

322
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:36,289
Hey, hold on.
Stay right there.

323
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:48,131
You're going down just like your buddy,
you son of a bitch.

324
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,609
Where's the kid?

325
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,783
Where's the kid?
- He's back here.

326
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,517
Get up.

327
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,049
Come on,
tough guy.

328
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,953
Let's go.

329
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:51,364
Maricruz?
Baby, open up.

330
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,601
It's me.
It's me, okay?

331
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:00,236
Fernando, what are you doing here?
You can't be here.

332
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,846
I know. Where's your sister?
I need to see her.

333
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,312
She's getting her picture
taken with my mom and dad.

334
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:08,145
The wedding's at 2:30.
- I need to see her now.

335
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,618
You have to go.
- She's the mother of my kid, Theresa.

336
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,223
Please.

337
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,622
You don't want her to marry Hector,
do you? Do you?

338
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,532
I'll go see if I can go get her.

339
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,568
Wait in here.
- Okay.

340
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,148
Lance, I got a question for you.
- Yes?

341
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,851
You know who I am?

342
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,261
I happened to see the news last night, yes.

343
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,261
Hey, I don't care.
I've got some skeletons in my closet too.

344
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,466
One of whom wears a dress.

345
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:03,031
Thank you.
I appreciate your lack of judgment.

346
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,472
From what I can tell,
you didn't do anything wrong.

347
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,737
But it's none of my business,
and you don't need to talk about it.

348
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,744
The whole thing just...

349
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,612
I never meant for it to happen.

350
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,517
Okay, you do not need
to answer this question.

351
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:25,154
But were you and that guy, like?

352
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,692
You're right,
I don't wanna talk about it.

353
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,506
You're done?
- Yeah.

354
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:41,771
Does it worry you that he's out there?

355
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,077
Give me one second.

356
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,555
Dad.
- Sara, hi.

357
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,664
I got your message.

358
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,322
Please, come in.

359
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,035
Lance, this is my father, Frank.

360
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,266
How do you do?
- Dad, this is my friend, Lance.

361
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,876
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
And I voted for you.

362
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,376
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

363
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,910
Sara, I can take off.
- No need.

364
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,746
Only take a minute.

365
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,353
You step into my office.
And you make yourself at home.

366
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:24,749
Sure.

367
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,493
So...

368
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:41,034
so in my program, we've been
talking a lot about making amends.

369
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:44,642
And I've been thinking a lot about...

370
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:49,204
About some of the choices I've made lately.

371
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,211
And I know that that affects you.

372
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,820
And I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry.

373
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:03,051
Well, you don't have to say you're sorry.
- Yeah, I do.

374
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:07,722
And it must be hard to
understand why I did it.

375
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:14,404
I had no idea that I was putting
these guys back out on the street.

376
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:17,405
I thought I was saving the
life of an innocent man.

377
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,909
And I know that you didn't read
the information I gave you...

378
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,378
...on Lincoln Burrows,
but he is innocent...

379
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,313
...and a lot of the people
involved right now are dead.

380
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:36,649
I'm sorry.
This isn't why I called you.

381
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,993
I'm fine.

382
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,765
But I'm scared.

383
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,560
Sara.

384
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,403
I'm gonna help you through this.

385
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,168
We're gonna get through this together.

386
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,672
Thank you.
- I promise.

387
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,608
Kellerman.
- We ran that trace you requested,

388
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,346
What'd you get?
- The line is disconnected,

389
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,491
And whose was it?
- Apparently no one,

390
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:11,322
What does that mean?
- It's been out of service for 17 years,

391
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,470
Fernando.

392
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,303
Where is she?
- Now, calm down. Calm down.

393
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,465
She's gonna come down and talk to you.

394
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,535
She's on her way down right now.

395
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:33,116
You and I got history.
We're family.

396
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:36,485
Out of respect for that,
I'm gonna let her make her own decisión.

397
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:39,623
I'm not leaving without her.
- That's for Maricruz to decide.

398
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,158
You've been filling her head with this crap.
- She's a smart girl.

399
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:46,422
I personally don't think she's gonna
wanna live her life on the run.

400
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,497
We'll see.
- You know she doesn't love you.

401
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,829
I don't wanna get into that right now.
- You're not raising my kid.

402
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,177
That don't sound good, cuz.

403
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:08,817
Maricruz? Baby? Where is she?
- You have to go.

404
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,682
Where is she?
- Please. They're coming.

405
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:14,086
Did you tell her I was here?
Did you?

406
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,956
Maricruz.

407
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:51,628
Mahone.

408
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:54,264
I'll be right down.

409
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,966
Mr. Mahone.
- Where are they?

410
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,372
I had a hard time getting my hands
on these. Be easier to go to a doctor.

411
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,273
You need something to calm your nerves.

412
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,108
Doctors take notes.
That's why I have a deal with you.

413
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:14,046
The way things have been going,
I thought our deal was over.

414
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,244
You don't ask me about shales no more.
- That part is over.

415
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,549
I no longer need an informant on the case.

416
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,693
I thought that's all you cared about,
was finding him.

417
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,721
Can't get them all.
- I can keep an ear out on the street...

418
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,958
Midazolam, 1500 milligrams every 30 days.
That's all I want from you.

419
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,597
We understand each other?

420
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,864
You gonna pay me for it?

421
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,969
Right there.

422
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:49,009
What are you doing here?
- We had to come for you, buddy.

423
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,747
How'd you know?
- T-Bag.

424
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,185
Hand over the map.

425
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,619
What?
- The map.

426
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,259
Hand it over.

427
00:34:58,296 --> 00:34:59,524
He told you I had it?

428
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:18,948
We are gonna sort this out right now.

429
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,951
Tell me that's not what I know it is.

430
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,757
It is.
But don't worry.

431
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:34,386
Before I destroyed it,
I committed it to my photographic memory.

432
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,295
Coming from a compulsive liar,
I find that hard to believe.

433
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,835
I'd have tattooed it to my body,
but I didn't have the time.

434
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,973
Whenever you strip-search a lifer,
you should always check his coin purse.

435
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,673
Tell us where the money is.

436
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,811
Now, let's not dissolve into threats,
all right?

437
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,418
I'm gonna take the high road here.
Suggest a mutually beneficial arrangement.

438
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,212
I have the information.

439
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,014
You have the manual requirements...

440
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,056
...necessary to unearth
Westmoreland's buried booty.

441
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,284
We're partners.
- And why is that?

442
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:06,328
Because as of this moment,
I'm your map.

443
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,769
So then, yo,
we split it four ways, right?

444
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,374
Wrong.
Get in.

445
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,401
You're not worth 1.5.

446
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,944
Get in.
- Okay.

447
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,366
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

448
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,933
Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah.

449
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,241
It's hot.

450
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:02,514
I was really wondering how
much you're selling your RV for.

451
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,088
Probably out of your price range.
- Come on. Give me a shot.

452
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,219
Forty thousand dollars.

453
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:15,898
Look, I tell you what.

454
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,967
I'll be back in a couple of days, okay?

455
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,597
I can't hold it for you.

456
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,830
I said I'll be back.

457
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,235
With cash.

458
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,723
Nice bike.

459
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,301
The wedding's at 2:30, Fernando,

460
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,271
We just got confirmation
on Fernando sucre.

461
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,174
He was in Las Vegas around 2.

462
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,939
Then a gas station attendant...

463
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:10,452
...spotted a guy on a bike matching
his description in Mesquite...

464
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,215
...an hour later.

465
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:16,257
Out west.
Just like Bagwell and Franklin.

466
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,860
Yeah, but he was heading east...

467
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,327
...and Bagwell's in Nebraska
on I-80 heading west...

468
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,899
...and Franklin's train was heading west,
but he jumped off to the...

469
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:33,207
You know D.B. Cooper?
- Yeah, the hijacker.

470
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,811
But he was never found.
- But he's gotta be somewhere.

471
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,007
Someone hijacked that plane
in Portland and jumped out
over the Pacific Northwest...

472
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:44,177
...and someone was arrested
two days later in Bisbee, Arizona.

473
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:45,822
Not the same guy.
- Same guy.

474
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,981
Same guy who was treated
for a broken knee...

475
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,457
...at a free clinic somewhere
around salt Lake City.

476
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:53,654
Same guy whose Nova blew a head
gasket 10 miles short of the border.

477
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,732
Same guy who almost got
away with a stolen car...

478
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,835
...but he ran a woman down in Bisbee.

479
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,630
Vehicular manslaughter.

480
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:04,536
Arrested and booked as
Charles Westmoreland.

481
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,170
But he didn't have the money on him.

482
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,210
Which means...

483
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,405
...he got rid of it somewhere along the way.

484
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:15,519
This is fact? You figured all this out?
- No, scofield did.

485
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,348
That's why he was bringing the old man.
The money's in Utah.

486
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,888
And they're all going to get it.

487
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:27,956
You know, in Thailand,
they got a black market...

488
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,124
...where you can get any surgery you need,
even a hand transplant.

489
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,597
You're sick,
you know that?

490
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,261
Keep going.
The turnoff's just up here somewhere.

491
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:38,067
Before or after sheep Road?

492
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,934
What's the matter?
Did you forget?

493
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,945
How could I forget a road called sheep?
It's after.

494
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,913
Don't you feel all warm inside
now that we're working together?

495
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,542
We aren't working together.
You're just here to lend a hand.

496
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:55,215
Wait, wait, slow down. That was it.
That little bitty road right back there.

497
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:19,640
How far is it from here?

498
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:23,344
A quarter mile,
if I remember the scale properly.

499
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,148
Let's start walking.

500
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:49,101
Frank?
- Yeah, I'm almost ready.

501
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,976
What time did you say the flight was?
- Eight.

502
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:56,313
Listen, I hope you get this nomination
more than anyone, but be prepared.

503
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,216
This Burrows thing may steamroll.

504
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:02,689
Well, we'll wait it out, just like you said.
- Problem is too many headlines.

505
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,851
His lawyer, Nick savrinn,
is already dead.

506
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,088
His kid's awaiting trial for double homicide...

507
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,789
...and now his lead counsel
is classified as missing.

508
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,561
Well, is she missing or is she dead?

509
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,133
I just thought you should know
before you go to Washington.

510
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:19,065
Bruce, is there something
connecting all of this?

511
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:22,679
It's probably best you don't
ask a whole lot of questions.

512
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,787
Where now?

513
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,560
Right up there.

514
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:41,824
The hill borders the property.

515
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,762
The K.K. Is on the other side.

516
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,365
First thing I'm gonna do with the money:

517
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,903
Buy new shoes.
- Second thing, tacos.

518
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,564
Third thing,
ice-cold beer.

519
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:55,234
Fourth thing,
a little toothpaste.

520
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,289
Mahone.
- Agent Mahone, your car's out front, sir,

521
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:19,129
The flight to Utah leaves in an hour,
- I'll be there. Thank you.

522
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:47,456
Ninth thing,
a shower.

523
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:52,568
Tenth thing, a good night's sleep.
- A nice hotel. Clean sheets.

524
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:57,103
Look, stakes marking the property line.
Should be dead ahead.

525
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,405
Can you see the silo?

526
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,779
The bastards built over it.

527
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,320
It's gone.
