1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:02,935
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:04,798
I didn't kill that man, Michael.

3
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:06,939
If you didn't kill Terrence steadman...

4
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:09,132
...how did someone
make it look like you did?

5
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,436
I'm getting you out of here.
- That's impossible.

6
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,602
Not if you designed the place,
it isn't.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,428
It better be open, bro.

8
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,537
You're asking me to break the law.
- I ask you to make a mistake.

9
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,536
Forget to lock up.

10
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:42,871
We're in.

11
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,874
Who killed Terrence steadman?

12
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,746
Nobody.
Terrence steadman's still alive.

13
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,250
Hello, Terrence.

14
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:56,612
Sound the alarm.

15
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,232
Hey!
Hey!

16
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,111
No!
No!

17
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,480
What do we do now?
- We run.

18
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,757
The escapees,
who were they?

19
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,263
Got a list right here.

20
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,658
Read it to me,
if you could.

21
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,228
Michael scofield,
structural engineer.

22
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,529
Five years for armed robbery,

23
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,638
Benjamin Miles Franklin.

24
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:51,309
Former U, S, Army,
Eight years for possessión of stolen goods,

25
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,936
John Abruzzi.

26
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,650
Don of the crime family of the same name,

27
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:02,151
Life without parole for
conspiracy to commit murder.

28
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,950
Charles "Haywire" Patoshik,

29
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,959
sixty years for second-degree murder.

30
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,292
Fernando sucre.

31
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,058
Five years for aggravated robbery,

32
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,363
David "Tweener" Apolskis.

33
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,470
Five years for grand larceny.

34
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,941
Theodore "T-Bag" Bagwell.

35
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,508
Life for six counts of kidnapping,
rape and first-degree murder.

36
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,951
And Lincoln Burrows.

37
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,193
Scheduled to die next week for the
murder of President Reynolds' brother,

38
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,891
How long has it been since
they got over the wall?

39
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,263
Eight o'clock last night,

40
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:55,464
scofield. He and Burrows are brothers.
- That's right.

41
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,673
And he's the mastermind
of this whole thing,

42
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,676
That's what they're saying.

43
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,177
I want everything they've got on him.

44
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,513
Where are they?

45
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,821
What the hell is that?

46
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,992
Let's go.

47
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,396
We gotta make it to the other side!
- What?

48
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,096
Make it to the other side!
- Crazy!

49
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,774
Come on!
- Come on, run!

50
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,779
We gotta go! Run!
Let's go! Move it, move it!

51
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,520
Go!
- The thing is gaining speed, man!

52
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,762
It's going too fast!
- Go through!

53
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,161
What?
- Go through!

54
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,027
Michael!

55
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,734
Hold your fire!

56
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,117
Freeze!
I will gun you down, scofield!

57
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,946
Michael, come on.

58
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,469
Where's the aerial unit?
- They're back on the ground refueling.

59
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,372
Son of a bitch.

60
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,705
Sir, the media is ready.

61
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:26,508
I'd like to talk about John Wilkes
Booth for a moment, if I could.

62
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,654
Abraham Lincoln's killer.

63
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,413
Twelve days.

64
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,751
That's how long it took to find him.

65
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:36,452
In his journal during this period,
he wrote that the shadow was his friend...

66
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,290
...the night his domain.

67
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,232
He acknowledged that
neuroses driving the criminal,,,

68
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,030
,,, to commit the original
crime is compounded,,,

69
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,734
,,, magnified by flight,

70
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,267
By the sounds of dogs at his heels,

71
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,269
Fear becomes paranoia.

72
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,340
Paranoia, ultimately psychosis,

73
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,610
I bring this up because in 140 years...

74
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,657
...the fundamental mind of the
escaped man has not changed.

75
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:11,490
The escaped man is still human,
he is still afraid...

76
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,963
...and he will stop at nothing
in his attempted flight.

77
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:17,926
Fortunately for us,,,

78
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:24,009
,,, while our quarry has
shadow and night as his ally,,,

79
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,805
...we have something far greater.

80
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,879
Televisión.

81
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,013
I would encourage
everyone who is watching...

82
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,887
...everyone in this country,
to take a good look at these faces.

83
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:41,792
These men right here are now the
eight most wanted men in America.

84
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:52,564
I thought I thought this out.
You saw all those guys back there?

85
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,968
The key is they're back
there and we're up here.

86
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,836
Yeah.
And how long is that gonna last?

87
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,204
Especially since we don't
have a pot to piss in...

88
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,573
...thanks to Abruzzi's
magically disappearing jet.

89
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,738
You were never gonna be on that plane.

90
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,907
Don't think I don't know
where you were going.

91
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,246
Where am I going?
- Oh, I don't know.

92
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,888
Utah?

93
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,981
You planning on telling
us about the money?

94
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,690
What money?

95
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:19,025
Five million dollars that Westmoreland
planted in the desert in Utah.

96
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,500
You don't know what you're talking about.
- You wish I didn't know.

97
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,194
Wait, wait.
What money?

98
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,503
Warden.

99
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,840
It's a little early for the FBI to
be showing up, don't you think?

100
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,275
Look, I get it.
It's still your investigation.

101
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,544
Once those criminals cross state lines,
it'll become a federal matter.

102
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,689
Yeah, well, that is not gonna happen.
- I hope you're right.

103
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,553
That's why I suggest that we cut through
any interagency politics from the outset.

104
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,560
Full transparency.
- Absolutely.

105
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,197
Good.

106
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,129
Then maybe you can tell
me about Dr. Tancredi.

107
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,692
There's nothing to tell.

108
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,067
From what I'm hearing,
she may have abetted the escapees.

109
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,731
Opened the door that
allowed them to get out.

110
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,706
Like I said, there's nothing to tell.
- You're not being very transparent, warden.

111
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,646
Look, I don't discuss my staff.
- Maybe you should...

112
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,081
...because she may be the key to this thing.

113
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,622
We need to speak with her.

114
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:23,220
Well, right now, Mr. Mahone,
she's not gonna be speaking with anyone.

115
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,964
How we doing?

116
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,402
Well, the IVs are hydrating her.

117
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,271
We've got her on naloxone infusión.
Half-milligram per hour.

118
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,776
What do you think the chances are?

119
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:44,007
Well, we've done everything on our end.
It's really up to her.

120
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:49,052
Either she fights and lives,
or she quits and dies.

121
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,873
Hey, what do you think...?

122
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,503
Do whatever thing you've gotta do, man.

123
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:57,249
Oh, and boy...

124
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,255
If you call the cops,
I will put this thing right here...

125
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,728
...in your eye.

126
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,932
Thank you.

127
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,246
Structural engineer, huh?

128
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,017
Not the kind you'd expect
to get that much ink.

129
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,420
Not the kind at all.

130
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,692
How long do you think it'd take
to get something like that done?

131
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,298
A hundred hours.
Two hundred.

132
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:45,062
Tattoo artist who gave it to him must've
spent a lot of time with him, then.

133
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,833
I'll find out who it was.

134
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,273
Mr. Bellick.
- Don't talk to me.

135
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,812
Fine. But it's gonna make
collaboration kind of hard.

136
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,814
Collaboration?
I got men out here in harm's way...

137
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,815
...and you're giving press conferences.

138
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,419
The press is a tool.

139
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,113
It'll bring those men back
quicker than bloodhounds will.

140
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,519
We don't need you.

141
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,718
We're hot on the trail,
it's a matter of time till we nail them.

142
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,125
The problem I find with being on a trail...

143
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,495
...is that, by definition,
you'll always be behind your prey.

144
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,737
We'll see about that.

145
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,512
I'm not armed.

146
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,775
You'll have to excuse me if I'm a
little short on trust at the moment.

147
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:35,751
I assure you, young woman,
I'm the furthest thing from a threat.

148
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,515
I think the Percocet pretty
much ensures that.

149
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:43,253
Good. Then you won't mind if I
capture this moment for posterity.

150
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,488
Won't do you any good.

151
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,959
You don't care that somebody's
gonna be executed for your murder?

152
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,933
I'm not the one who chose
Lincoln Burrows as the fall guy.

153
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,571
Who did?

154
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,104
Your sister,
the president?

155
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,868
You don't understand.
I'm a prisoner to all of this.

156
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,170
Oh, come on.
You could've come forward.

157
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,076
You could've stopped this thing
before it even got started.

158
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,547
No, I really am a prisoner.

159
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,242
And now you are too.

160
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,346
The moment you let the
door shut behind you.

161
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,123
Didn't it strike you as curious...

162
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,235
...that there wasn't any security out there?

163
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,963
The doors only open from the outside.

164
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,506
The glass is 2 inches thick, bulletproof.

165
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,211
There's no getting out of here,
young woman.

166
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,544
We gotta dump them now.

167
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:45,181
Can't.
They know about Utah.

168
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,847
All the more reason to dump them.

169
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,894
If they get caught, the feds will know
where we're going. They'll tell them.

170
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,430
We just gotta make sure they
stay afloat till we're off in Utah.

171
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,534
Doing what we gotta do.

172
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,665
You really think the
money's gonna be there?

173
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,838
Charles might've had a flexible
relationship with the truth...

174
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,276
...but at the end... At the end,
there'd be no reason for him to lie about it.

175
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,949
I figure once we bag it,
we cross over into Mexico.

176
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:17,221
Take a whole bunch of bumpy
second-class bus rides till we hit Panama.

177
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,253
You really got a fix on this dive shop thing?
- Yeah.

178
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,055
Right now, I wouldn't mind swinging in
a hammock for the next 10, 20 years.

179
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,200
We got half the country after us.
We ain't making it to Panama or Utah.

180
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,597
Not without help.

181
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,301
Veronica can't help us.

182
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,702
How can you say that?

183
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,811
We don't have money, clothes...
- We got all that.

184
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,474
I thought the plan was Abruzzi's jet.

185
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,138
Abruzzi's jet was plan A.

186
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,876
Then we got...
- Everything we need.

187
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,486
Where?

188
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,190
Storage.

189
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,659
Scofield designed the tattoo,
not you?

190
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,634
He brought the entire thing in.
Every element.

191
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,399
I mean, look at it.
It's the frigging sistine Chapel.

192
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,543
I know the guy was an engineer, but, man...

193
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,372
...his skill as an artist was unbelievable.

194
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,946
What else? What can you tell
me about him as a person?

195
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,278
He was cool,
you know.

196
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,784
But talk about a detail Nazi.
Everything had to be perfect.

197
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:26,721
Exactly as he drew it.
I always sort of had the feeling...

198
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:31,329
...that the whole thing was some sort
of inside joke that only he was in on.

199
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:36,932
We have your number, right?

200
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,694
Yeah.

201
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,934
I may be calling you.
Thank you.

202
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,137
Foley.

203
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,878
What was the name of that
road to get to the prison?

204
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,574
I think it was English street.

205
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,687
In front of the prison,
the two streets that intersect with it?

206
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:03,021
Fitz and Percy. Why?
- Thank you.

207
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:09,033
Saddle up.
- Where we going?

208
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,261
Somewhere we can stop being
cons and start being civilians.

209
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:16,636
Yo, why don't you cut out all the riddles,
snowflake, and just give it to us straight?

210
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,208
What?

211
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:24,147
Hi.
- Hi.

212
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,242
Well, hey,
little one.

213
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,978
What are you doing?

214
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,952
Well...

215
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,821
We're just fishing.

216
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,494
With no poles?

217
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,463
Well, we like to fish with our hands.

218
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,226
Yeah, that's it.
Hand-fishing.

219
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,030
I think the question is...

220
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,508
...what are you doing out here?

221
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,174
Hunting.
- Gracie?

222
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,407
Get away, Gracie.
Get away. Get back.

223
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,607
You're those guys from Fox River.

224
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,879
Don't any of you move a freaking muscle.

225
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,228
Get away from her.
Get away from her!

226
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,891
Okay, okay.
Just relax.

227
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,999
Relax.

228
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,937
Sir...
- You stay where you are.

229
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,969
No, no! John!
- Put the gun down! Put the gun down.

230
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,372
Let her go!
- Right now!

231
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,638
Let her go!
- John, let go of the girl.

232
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,406
Shut up!
- Let her go.

233
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,210
Put it down.
Drop the gun.

234
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,682
You drop the gun.
Drop it now.

235
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,089
You put the gun down.

236
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,982
One...

237
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,423
I'm gonna pull the trigger.

238
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,120
Two!

239
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:52,299
Good boy.
Good boy.

240
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,497
Get the gun.

241
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,402
Pick it up!

242
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,838
Don't you hurt her. Don't you lay a...
- Hey!

243
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,138
Gonna be all right.

244
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,044
Right?

245
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,744
Run to Daddy.

246
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,121
I ain't gonna say anything to anybody, man.

247
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,090
You're not gonna get hurt,
so just calm down. Where's your car?

248
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,422
Up on the road.
- I need your keys.

249
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,468
You're being considered
an accessory to this.

250
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,909
You know that,
don't you?

251
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,372
I know very little right now.

252
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,883
You opened the door to the infirmary
that allowed scofield to escape.

253
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,352
Didn't you?
- No.

254
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,117
You have a sexual relationship with him?
- No.

255
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,852
But you had feelings for him.

256
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,225
Seven other men got out,
you know.

257
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,232
Who?

258
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,247
I'm sorry, sir, it's saturday.
We're not open.

259
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,614
Well, that's sort of the point.

260
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,050
Sorry, sir?

261
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:23,661
See, I'm gonna need some work done
and I'm gonna need it done privately.

262
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,990
I'm sorry,
you said you needed the work done?

263
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,092
This is a medical clinic,
isn't it?

264
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,830
Well, of course it is, sir,
but for animals.

265
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:38,766
God, man,
what happened to you?

266
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,912
You need medical attention.

267
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,546
No.
- I'm gonna get an ambulance.

268
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:49,086
Nobody's gonna be doing
any calling here, doctor.

269
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,778
Fine.

270
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,415
That's right.

271
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,593
What do you want?

272
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,059
You know what?
That's it.

273
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:08,104
I want Eyetie out of the car right now, man.
That was a little girl.

274
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,173
Don't you have a heart?

275
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,037
God, I have a daughter.
I have a little girl.

276
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,737
I got one too.

277
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,279
But if I hadn't done what I had to do...

278
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,851
...we wouldn't be on our
way to see them right now.

279
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,319
Turn right up there.

280
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,616
Whoa, hold on.
Where we going?

281
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,487
Oswego.

282
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,096
That's west, man. We need to go east.
My family's back in Chicago.

283
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,255
And you think the cops don't know about it?

284
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,034
You think they're not just sitting there...

285
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:40,296
...waiting for you to come
running back home?

286
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,430
What's the matter with you?

287
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,906
What about New York?
- What about it?

288
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,339
My girl's pregnant, bro.

289
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:50,948
Understand, your love is
your weakness right now.

290
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,846
And they know about it.
- Doesn't mean it has to stop you.

291
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,479
You just gotta be smart about it.

292
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,918
And get to oswego.

293
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,685
Oswego is not on the way, snowflake.

294
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,488
It's not where oswego is.

295
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,057
It's what's in oswego.

296
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:12,492
Captain, scofield's credit-card
transaction history.

297
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,105
Spent money in Will County
before he was incarcerated.

298
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,242
Exactly.
- He's from Chicago.

299
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,138
Why does a guy from Chicago come here...

300
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,711
...and spend 8 grand in all
these places in a month?

301
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,745
Car wash, voice mail, storage,
car rental.

302
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,473
We got guys looking into it.
- Good.

303
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,176
What about the feds? Should we tell?
- What do you think?

304
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,877
Captain Bellick,
we got something.

305
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,320
Hunter up by Tamarack just
ran into five of the cons.

306
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,059
So this is where scofield lived.

307
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:45,633
Yeah, up until about two months
ago when he was incarcerated.

308
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,975
Mother's dead,
father's a deadbeat.

309
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:56,576
Got nothing in the whole
worid but your brother.

310
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,586
So you plan.

311
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,734
And you scheme for months...

312
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,739
...until you get it right.

313
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,272
Every single element.

314
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,751
And then you destroy all the evidence.

315
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,227
I want divers down in the river.

316
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,434
You won't get cell coverage.

317
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,769
We're in the middle of nowhere.

318
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:03,475
Those digital carriers don't have cell
towers way out here in Western Montana.

319
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,811
How about shutting up, Terrence?
- Just trying to save you some effort.

320
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,113
They're like a web, these people.
Harder you struggle, worse it gets.

321
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,950
Sounds to me like a coward
trying to justify himself.

322
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,459
If I stay out of the way and stay quiet,
I stay alive.

323
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,789
That's what they said.
That's what they told me.

324
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,762
And you want to live like this?
In a hermetically sealed box...

325
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:25,835
...while everything out there goes to hell?
- Self-preservation is a strong motivator.

326
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,298
So's the truth.

327
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,639
Don't.

328
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,904
Young woman.

329
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,012
Do not.

330
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,918
Don't.

331
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,524
How you doing, buddy?

332
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,822
I'm pretty freaked out,
that's how I'm doing.

333
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,631
They took your car,
didn't they?

334
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,131
1978 Grand Cherokee?

335
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,064
Yeah.
- Which way did they go?

336
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,568
Up that way.
North, toward oswego.

337
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,502
Oswego.
Pardon me.

338
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,471
Scofield's paperwork,
get it to me.

339
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,201
That credit card stuff.

340
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,243
Right here, captain.

341
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,543
Of course.

342
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,218
Where else you gonna put all
the crap you need to disappear?

343
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,684
We're going to oswego, boys.

344
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,202
You have a visitor.

345
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,668
Thank you.

346
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,944
Thanks.

347
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,853
You look disappointed.

348
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,353
No, I thought you were gonna be my father.

349
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,352
You heard from him?

350
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,052
His office.

351
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,822
Well, brought you a change of clothes.

352
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:06,002
Figured, you know.
- Thanks.

353
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,835
And your purse.

354
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,697
You left it in the infirmary.

355
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,779
I'm in a lot of trouble,
I think.

356
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,353
I...

357
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:28,715
I need to apologize to you.

358
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:44,508
They threatened my job if I didn't talk, and...

359
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,904
No, no.
No.

360
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,777
One thing you learn when
you're walking the steps...

361
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:53,384
...is that you never outsource the blame
that belongs in your own back yard.

362
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,946
Well...

363
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:02,215
...you're not the first correctional
worker that fell for a con.

364
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,055
Trust me.

365
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,432
He never cared.

366
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,699
Not one bit.

367
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,141
What are you thinking about?

368
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,113
Mistakes.

369
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,849
You had to do it.

370
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,219
Not like I did.

371
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,180
I ruined her life.

372
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:36,887
There's nothing you can do about it now.
- That's not true.

373
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,129
You fell for her, huh?

374
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,333
Where's oswego?

375
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,597
Half a mile, maybe.

376
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,634
Good.

377
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,335
What are you gonna do, Terrence,
shoot me?

378
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:57,003
Blow my guts all over the house?
Then what?

379
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,173
You can't leave, remember?

380
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,911
You kill me,
you're stuck with me.

381
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,552
I'm safe here.

382
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,486
You're a prisoner here.

383
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,888
But I'm still breathing.

384
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,456
If I go outside...

385
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,158
...one step,
I won't be.

386
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,962
You look at me like I'm the devil.

387
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,135
I gave up my family.

388
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:29,408
My teeth.
I eat Percocet all day...

389
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,913
...just to dull the pain of
my miserable existence.

390
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:37,020
You have no idea what I've been through.
- What you've been through?

391
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,625
This isn't about you, Terrence.

392
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:42,754
Don't.

393
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,363
Blackfoot Sheriff's Department,

394
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,931
Hello?
Blackfoot Sheriff's Department,

395
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,628
Hello, my name's Veronica Donovan.

396
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:58,537
I need you to send a unit to the house at
the end of Light Road as soon as possible.

397
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,042
I'm sorry, ma'am,
are you calling to report a crime?

398
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,208
Yeah.

399
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,645
By the president of the United states.

400
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:08,916
Send the car.

401
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,651
I'm sorry, sir,
I don't think I can do this.

402
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,450
There are nerves.
Look...

403
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,253
You need a specialist.
- I don't...

404
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,487
You need somebody who
knows what they're doing.

405
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,631
I don't have the luxury of choice here.

406
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,393
My hand has been in that
box for hours now. It is dying.

407
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,160
Sir, I am not capable of doing this.

408
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:29,272
I only have one hand, but I can stick this
in your neck before you get to that door.

409
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:33,673
Now, if that's not incentive enough for you,
I see that you have a Mrs. Gudat out there.

410
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,836
With a name like that in a county like this...

411
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:38,847
...old Mrs. Gudat would not be
too hard to find, now, would she?

412
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,175
Fine.

413
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,980
I can promise you nothing.

414
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,586
Story of my life.

415
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,756
I'll have to put you under.

416
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,159
Do I really look that stupid?

417
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,993
Sir, I cannot do a procedure
like this without an anesthetic.

418
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,691
I have to cut away dead flesh.

419
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:01,532
Nobody can undergo a procedure
like this without an anesthetic.

420
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:05,335
I ain't nobody.

421
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:11,746
Schweitzer was the company
that made the toilet scofield
took off to get out of his cell.

422
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:15,408
The Allen bolt was the fitting.
- It's all here, isn't it?

423
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,249
Yeah.
- It's amazing.

424
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:22,426
Ripe Chance Woods. Is there a
place in the vicinity with that name?

425
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,822
Got someone looking into it.

426
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:27,453
DoC's moving on a
storage facility in oswego.

427
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,377
Captain, manager says that scofield's
got a lease on Unit 164. still active.

428
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,020
We have guys on 8th street,
3rd street and in the alley.

429
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:53,419
Lf they're in there, we got them boxed.
- We push right up the gut, then.

430
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,287
Any one of them makes a threatening
move, put a hole in them.

431
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,689
You got it.

432
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,857
Officer.

433
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:07,168
This is my collar, smart guy.
Back the hell off.

434
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,814
Close the door.

435
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,983
Still nothing on this place?

436
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,851
Nope.
They're coming back with nothing.

437
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,461
No place by that name
anywhere in this country...

438
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,221
...or any other country for that matter.

439
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,606
Let's go.

440
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,892
Son of a bitch set us up.

441
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,126
Not one word.

442
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:45,868
Officer.

443
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,434
Nothing.

444
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,274
Oh, that kid's clever.

445
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,851
It's not a place,
it's a name.

446
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:06,384
Your PDA, you got it?
- Yeah.

447
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,817
Bring up the census of this county.

448
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,053
Far back as it goes.

449
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:18,124
Well, somebody's gonna see us.
- Keep digging.

450
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,800
We're gonna go to hell, guys.
Swear to God, we're gonna go to hell.

451
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,372
Help me out.

452
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,649
You are one sick cat,
you know that?

453
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,490
What are you looking for?

454
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,958
We gotta go to the cemetery.

455
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,361
Now.

456
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,599
Originally, this was supposed to be a
week's worth of clothes for me and Linc.

457
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,508
But I figured you all need just
as much help as we do, so...

458
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,979
You're doing this out of the
goodness of your heart?

459
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,846
Right, John, the heart.
You remember what that is, don't you?

460
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,011
Damn, snowflake,
this is tight, man.

461
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,783
It's like I said,
we gotta stop being cons...

462
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,653
...start being civilians.

463
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,579
Nice. The trousers are a little bit too short,
don't you think?

464
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,307
Chop your feet off.
You're good at that.

465
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,315
This jacket isn't exactly the best thing.

466
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:44,455
You know what I'm saying?
- You want variety, hit Target.

467
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:49,888
Linc.

468
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,723
What have we got?

469
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,858
Money, passports...

470
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,895
...prepaid phone cards.

471
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,572
Archie Ryan?
- You see mine?

472
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:02,967
Phineas McClintock.

473
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,073
Whoa, and these?

474
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:12,012
Keys to a car that's waiting for us a
couple of hundred yards from here.

475
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,749
That a two-of-us or five-of-us?

476
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,681
That's a two-of-us.

477
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,788
They know?
- Not yet.

478
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,352
Guys, guys.
We got company.

479
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,043
We gotta roll.

480
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,413
How did he know?

481
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,765
We're civilians.
Remember that.

482
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,961
We're civilians.

483
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:19,634
I'm sorry. Do you know what time it is?
- No, I'm sorry.

484
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:38,223
I can't go outside.
They'll kill me as soon as I show my face.

485
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:39,624
You're wrong about that.

486
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,698
As soon as you show your face,
this whole thing is gonna be over.

487
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,562
You can have your life back, Terrence.

488
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,801
Promise?
- I promise.

489
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,131
Hello?

490
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,868
V, it's me.

491
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,706
Linc?
- We're out,

492
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,111
oh, thank God you're okay.
I saw the news. You gotta stop.

493
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:01,376
I need you to turn yourself in,
- What?

494
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:05,386
I found steadman.
I'm with him now, Linc. He's alive.

495
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,921
You're gonna be exonerated.

496
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,851
Come in.
- Steadman?

497
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:11,858
What are you talking,
you found steadman?

498
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,327
Terrence, come on, let's go.
- Afternoon.

499
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,193
Veronica,
- The police are here.

500
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,528
Look, I need you to stay where you are.

501
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,762
Ma'am,
- I don't wanna lose you.

502
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,839
Ma'am, put the phone down.
- What?

503
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:26,738
Mr. Steadman,
take a few steps back.

504
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,107
Ver... Veronica?

505
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,279
Veronica?

506
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,075
Oh, my God.

507
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,113
Veronica!

508
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,397
I thought you knew that all calls to the
local station are routed through us.

509
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:22,122
This is federal land, remember?

510
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:27,461
And as for your little toy here.
It's contraband.

511
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:31,768
You gonna tell us how you got it in there?
- I brought it when I got here.

512
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,638
Whatever for?
- To protect myself.

513
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:40,107
That's what we're here for, remember?

514
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,317
In less than a day,
the trail has gone cold,,,

515
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,186
,,, in pursuit of what are being
called the Fox River Eight...

516
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,224
That's fine.
Stay on top of it, all right?

517
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,455
DoC's still doing a sweep of oswego
but they have basically vanished.

518
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:04,158
I wouldn't be sure about that, Ives.
- Don't know how you can be so confident.

519
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,530
It's not like they left a
map where they're going.

520
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,298
Actually, that's exactly what they did.

521
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,069
Scofield had the entire thing on his body.

522
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,475
How to get out of that prison,
how to disappear afterward,

523
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,178
It's all there,

524
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:24,217
I promise you that it's only a matter
of time before we know everything...

525
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,948
...that is in scofield's head.

526
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,589
Where he plans to run to,
how he plans to get there,

527
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,921
So when the time comes
that he does get there,,,

528
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,390
...we'll be waiting for him.
