1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,303
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:06,236
Those ass-hats are worth more
dead than you and I are alive.

3
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,431
Somebody's gonna get that money.
Might be me.

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:12,374
A job like that might go a little
smoother with an extra pair of hands.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,073
I want divers down in the river.

6
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,714
Are you Scott Kolbrenner?
- You must be Debra Jean,

7
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,546
It's nice to meet you.
- Same here.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,211
Apparently, Fibonacci's
coming up for air again.

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,019
And if he testifies at that hearing,
a lot of people are going down.

10
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,390
Caroline, they're taking her in.
Of course. I'll keep an eye on her.

11
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,258
Hi, my name is sara and I'm an addict.

12
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:36,163
Hi, my name is Lance and I'm an addict.
- Hi, Lance.

13
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,597
You did one hell of a job, doc.
- It's okay for you to leave now.

14
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,639
Oh, I'm leaving,
you're not.

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,445
Where to, sir?
- Utah.

16
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:48,945
Ready?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,720
So which one of them was it?
- Might be scofield.

18
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,984
Probably gonna find his
brother in there too.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,991
Are you meeting up with her?

20
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,096
Your doctor?
- I don't know.

21
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,464
I knew the little whore would
take us right to them.

22
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:15,005
What happens when you get to Mexico?
Where will you go?

23
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:19,009
It's best if you don't know.
It's best for everyone.

24
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:25,147
We'll drop you off in the next town,
and I'll wire you that 10,000, like I said.

25
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:28,078
Shouldn't take more than a week or two.

26
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,486
Michael, we got company.

27
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,200
What the hell's he doing?

28
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,604
Hold on! Hold on!
- Hold on!

29
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,501
Who is it?

30
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,645
Who is it?

31
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,440
It's Bellick.

32
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,219
Hold on!

33
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,187
Hold on,
hold on.

34
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,290
Duck! Down!
- Hold on, hold on.

35
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,222
Hold on.

36
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,499
Can this thing go any faster?

37
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,076
What do you think?

38
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,077
Look out!

39
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,015
Hold on!

40
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:04,580
Look out! Look out!
- Hold on!

41
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,024
Nobody move!

42
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,100
Nobody move!

43
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,966
Oh, good to see you again, boy.

44
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,766
No need for anyone to get hurt, boss.

45
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,710
Boss? Oh, there's no need for
formalities anymore there, sink.

46
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,943
I'm no longer an employee of the state,
thanks to you.

47
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,051
I think somebody wants that reward.

48
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,882
Oh, it's not about reward money, friend.

49
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,290
Your pal Manche told me all
about your little treasure hunt...

50
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,586
...for Westmoreland's stash.

51
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,294
Get in the car.

52
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,393
We're going to Utah.

53
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,200
Cops following you all over the country...

54
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,805
...when all they had to do was tail the tail,
you know.

55
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,497
Move that moneymaker, sweetheart.

56
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,302
Let's move it, convict.

57
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,446
If you know about the money in Utah,
why do you need us?

58
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:44,713
In the excitement of the escape, Manche
didn't hear everything Westmoreland said...

59
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,182
...before he kicked the bucket,
but he heard enough.

60
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:50,686
Utah and five million.
You'll fill in the blanks.

61
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,385
Hey!
- Don't even think about getting cute.

62
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,393
You and your brother are gonna
take me to where that money is...

63
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,724
...or the whore gets dead real fast.

64
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,890
Ask me if I'm bluffing.

65
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,876
The dredging of the river beneath
scofield's apartment bore some fruit.

66
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,548
Found a hard drive under the riverbed.

67
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,518
Serial numbers match an order
that scofield put in with Dell...

68
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,681
...a few months before he was incarcerated.

69
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:29,225
They've recovered about 12
percent of the data so far.

70
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,412
And this is helping us how?

71
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,813
Blood tests came back.
B negative all over that crash site.

72
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:56,011
Scofield and Burrows are...
- B negative, I know.

73
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,350
I'll reach out to the media.
- How about don't?

74
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,560
If it gets out that the guy...

75
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,659
...who masterminded this
whole thing is possibly dead...

76
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,357
...the other six cons are gonna
get their guards up more.

77
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,831
It is our policy...
Excuse me.

78
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:15,030
It is our policy not to announce
deaths until they're confirmed.

79
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,408
We found an exploding
car and a blood match.

80
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,808
Well, then do more tests.
- On what?

81
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,380
On the bumper. I don't know,
I don't care. Just delay.

82
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,417
I want those guys out there getting
more complacent, not more careful.

83
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,756
But the Iranian government promises
to forge ahead with its nuclear program,

84
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,554
In national news,
the eight escaped convicts,,,

85
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,721
,,, from Fox River Penitentiary
in Illinois are still at la...

86
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,230
I was listening to that.

87
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:47,931
Yeah, I wanna hear this.
- Really? You like John Denver?

88
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,398
Yeah.

89
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,503
Don't quit your day job.
- What?

90
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,846
No, I just need a little tequila
to get my karaoke on.

91
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,481
Yeah.

92
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:33,880
Hey, yo,
slow down.

93
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,786
We're doing, like, 65 in a 60...
- Yo, slow down.

94
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,221
All right, Dad.

95
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:51,729
You know, we can't be having that, man.
Tickets are, like, 200 bones.

96
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,599
Yeah.

97
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,440
I never thought I'd say this, scofield...

98
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:02,069
...but I thank God for the day
you walked into Fox River.

99
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,875
And out of it.

100
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,646
It's gonna be okay.

101
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:11,515
I don't wanna hear from you right now.
You told me nothing would happen.

102
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,482
You promised me.

103
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,893
Oh, that's one pissed off commie you
got on your hands there, scofield.

104
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,895
Didn't your mama tell you how to treat
a lady, or was she a whore like this one?

105
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,539
Linc.
- Got a problem there, Burrows?

106
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,767
We only need one of you
to take us to the money.

107
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,171
Remember that.

108
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,342
Let's go, buddy.

109
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,848
Let's go.

110
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,679
I'd been really drunk at
the wedding speech...

111
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,254
...and this was the first time
that we'd spoken since then.

112
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,927
And it was cleansing.
It was really cleansing.

113
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,653
Thank you.

114
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,863
Good share, Ralph.

115
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,163
Well, we're out of time,
unless there are any burning desires...

116
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,397
Actually, I'd like to...

117
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:05,010
...you know, if there's time.
- Of course.

118
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,477
I'm Lance,
and I'm an addict.

119
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,116
Hi, Lance.
- Hi, Lance.

120
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:17,046
My mother died of Ms. last week.

121
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:21,889
She just gave out.

122
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,757
Just like my grandfather did,
just like my sister did...

123
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,255
...just like I...

124
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,625
If I may?

125
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:36,799
Ms. isn't usually considered genetic.
- Really? What are you, a doctor?

126
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,770
I am, actually.

127
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,441
Sorry.

128
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,844
Thank you.

129
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,161
All right, everybody,
face the wall and look straight ahead.

130
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,241
Eyes front.

131
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,742
How was your flight?
- Bumpy. Everything's ready?

132
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:17,280
We got a container ship down at the
navy yard. Captain's one of ours.

133
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,112
He's got a stateroom listed as
a cargo hold on the manifest.

134
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,084
You and your family will be on
it when it sets sail tomorrow.

135
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:27,089
Six days from now, John,
you'll be in sardinia.

136
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,749
Good work.

137
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,464
Sylvia.

138
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,702
Dad.

139
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,733
Yeah.

140
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,704
We missed you.

141
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,777
Yes.

142
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,383
I missed you too.

143
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,557
It's over,
it's over.

144
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,527
Come on.

145
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,177
Come on,
come on.

146
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,112
What the hell are you doing?

147
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,148
Mind your own business.

148
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,340
What kind of son of a bitch doesn't
have a spare tire in his car?

149
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,066
The kind that already used it.

150
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:28,202
Well, then you're just the sad sack that has
to go back into town and get a new one.

151
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,608
That's like three miles.

152
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,181
That's right.

153
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,154
All right,
everybody out.

154
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,592
That way.
Go on.

155
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,833
Careful.
- Don't touch me.

156
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,301
Just relax.

157
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:59,410
You know, I believed everything you told
me, and I did everything you asked.

158
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,943
I risked my life for you.

159
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,741
For what?
For $ 10,000 I risked my life?

160
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:08,615
And this entire time you've had
$5 million just waiting there.

161
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,682
You're a bastard, Michael.

162
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:16,923
For all that aggravation, I hope you
get to hit that a few times, scofield.

163
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,224
We're gonna wait it out in that shack.

164
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,501
Just keep moving.
Come on.

165
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,641
Come on,
come on.

166
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,903
Fantasia, get going.

167
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,676
I need to talk to you alone.

168
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:43,315
What do you want?
- To ruin his life like he's ruined mine.

169
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:54,398
And what did you see, sir?
- I was overheating, so I pulled in.

170
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,898
This car was already here.

171
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,195
What about you?
- Oh, I was reading. I didn't see nothing.

172
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,168
Hey, buddy!

173
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,240
Where you coming from?

174
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:07,106
Me?
I was just hitting the head, boss.

175
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,769
What's your name?

176
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,810
Clyde.

177
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,420
Clyde May.
- You got any ID, Mr. May?

178
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:21,686
I don't drive anymore,
so I don't really have any ID per se.

179
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:27,930
Camel jockey left a big box of boom-boom
under my jeep back in Kandahar.

180
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,035
You military?
- Was.

181
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,639
Which one's your vehicle?
- These two sleds right here.

182
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,132
That is,
the in-between rides, anyhow.

183
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,074
Ain't much of a bag to be hitchhiking with.

184
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,911
I travel light.

185
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:46,108
You're just hoofing it out here,
middle of nowhere?

186
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:50,153
I do have the right to see a little bit of
the country I lost my hand for, don't I?

187
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,222
Why don't you tell me what this is about?

188
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,586
We got a vehicle here without a driver.

189
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,491
And at present,
you're the only driver without a vehicle.

190
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:02,998
Hell, is that what this is all about?
Why didn't you say so?

191
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:06,293
Dirty hippie kid dropping
a deuce in the facilities.

192
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,873
He came in with that car
not two minutes ago.

193
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,600
Check it out.

194
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,245
What were you, Army?

195
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,787
Hell, no.
Corps.

196
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:29,485
Well, then, semper fi, brother.
What outfit were you?

197
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,754
Hundred and ninety-sixth.

198
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,793
Hundred and ninety-sixth?

199
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,929
Never heard of it.
Where they out of?

200
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,462
Hey, sarge.

201
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,135
Hell, man,
I didn't do nothing.

202
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:50,604
Found these in his knapsack
after he said he had no car.

203
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,341
What?

204
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,055
Semper fi, brother.

205
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,556
Semper fi.

206
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,393
Stop stressing.
It doesn't do any good.

207
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,905
Maybe you ought to start stressing if
they're gonna put a bullet in our heads.

208
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:18,441
They need us.
They need us to get that money.

209
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,204
I admire your optimism.

210
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,975
She's rolling, man.
I can feel it.

211
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,109
So you wanna ruin scofield's life?
Well, get in line.

212
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,889
What are you really looking for?

213
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:36,517
Same as you. Money.
- Money? You want money?

214
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,454
Ten grand.
How's that sound?

215
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,759
We do it right now,
right there on those floorboards.

216
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,903
Not in a thousand years.

217
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,065
Beat it, then.
You got nothing else I need.

218
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,437
Typical man.
I'm talking about millions of dollars...

219
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,238
...and you'd piss it away for sex.
- That's right.

220
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,849
And I was hoping you wouldn't
let Michael outsmart you too.

221
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,611
Scofield ain't outsmarting no one.

222
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,516
You think that tire went flat by accident?

223
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,725
What are you offering?
- I can find out where the money is.

224
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,089
He trusts me.
- What do you want?

225
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,696
My fair share.

226
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:17,097
You find out where that money is,
your fair share is $200,000.

227
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,466
Out of five million? That's not very...
- I got the gun, girl.

228
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,698
You're lucky you're a partner at all.

229
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,269
I'll be right back.

230
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,318
Fibonacci's in DC.

231
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,954
Yeah, and he's in Denver, Atlanta, Miami.

232
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,716
I know.
- No, no, no. This time it's for real.

233
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,257
He's testifying again.

234
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,054
He's in Washington right now.

235
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,423
The Globe Hotel,
room 116.

236
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:49,226
Is this information any good?
- It's from New Jersey.

237
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,161
Fishhead Tommy wants to pay tribute.

238
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,569
Get the car.

239
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,477
Look at this room, John.

240
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,880
Look.

241
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,753
We can be a family again.

242
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:16,689
But you wanna risk it all, disrespect us.
And for what, for vengeance?

243
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,456
He betrayed me...
- I don't care.

244
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:20,655
He betrayed us.

245
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:28,940
I'm sorry,
you will never understand what happens...

246
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,104
...when you're in prison.

247
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,303
But you could go back to prison.

248
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,472
I swear to God...

249
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:45,620
...I'd rather die than go back.
There's no going back. Never, ever again.

250
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:50,525
Christ saved you, John.
Don't turn your back on him.

251
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,529
Don't turn your back on us.

252
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,604
I...

253
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,984
I don't know,
about 20 miles from Gunnison.

254
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,251
He's coming.
I have to go.

255
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,392
Who was that?

256
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,356
Nobody.
It's just my father.

257
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:29,831
All right.
- Hey, listen.

258
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,698
Do you mind if we stop at the next motel?

259
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,170
It's only, like, 4:00.
- Yeah, but we've been driving forever.

260
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:41,205
That's cool, I'll drive.
- I really just wanna stop.

261
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,177
But if we get on the road now...
- scott.

262
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:47,079
It's my car,
and I'm tired of being in it, okay?

263
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,880
All right.

264
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,658
Heard about the call coming in.

265
00:19:55,827 --> 00:20:00,025
Can you believe it? Of all the players,
it's the rat that could give us our first collar.

266
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,429
If you guys need to use the can,
hold it.

267
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:10,540
You need to tinkle, sweet pea,
I'll watch you anytime. Sit down.

268
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,939
Hands behind your back.

269
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:29,950
Took your time.

270
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,224
It takes time to gain a man's confidence.

271
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,436
You're right,
he'll bite on anything I say.

272
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:43,636
You just tell me where we trap him,
and I'll tell him that's where the money is.

273
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,795
Hey.
You're the guy from the gas station, right?

274
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,098
I'm the guy who was having car trouble.

275
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:16,497
Seems to be purring along now, huh?
- Yeah. Water pump.

276
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,237
Two hundred bucks for this heap.

277
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,471
They'll get you.

278
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,479
Look, I hope I'm not out of line...

279
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,778
...but I heard you telling the cop
back there about your hand.

280
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,821
My old man was killed in
Nam when I was a kid...

281
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,253
...so I have the utmost
respect for our servicemen.

282
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,017
Just serving my country.

283
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:39,220
A lot of us are grateful for it.
Listen, if you need a ride or something...

284
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:46,232
Well, to be honest with you,
my dogs are kind of barking.

285
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,168
Well, all right.

286
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,171
Jerry Curtin.

287
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:54,737
Clyde.
Clyde May.

288
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:58,872
My kid Danny is riding shotgun.
I hope you don't mind sitting in the back.

289
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,078
Hi.
I'm Danielle.

290
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,849
Hi, yourself.

291
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,269
Hey.
- What do you want?

292
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,671
I need to use the bathroom.
- Again?

293
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,406
I have a small bladder.

294
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,066
That ain't all you got.

295
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,375
Get up.

296
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,425
Well?

297
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:48,498
They plan to trap you. The big one,
he's got friends in Utah.

298
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,761
Criminals.
A town called Panguitch.

299
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,666
They grow drugs on a farm there.

300
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,808
They'll tell you that's where the money is,
but no money.

301
00:22:56,975 --> 00:23:00,411
Just old friends with guns,
waiting for you.

302
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:05,573
Easy enough.
We take a pass on Panguitch.

303
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,987
Where's the money really?
- I'll find out soon enough.

304
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,150
But 200,000 was old
price for this information.

305
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:21,659
I want a new price.
- She's trying to renegotiate.

306
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,963
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be face-down in a marijuana farm.

307
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,572
One third.

308
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:34,170
It's gonna take a lot more than information
if you want a million-six, sweet pea.

309
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,742
Such as?
- You know.

310
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:42,285
Piece of that can, anytime I want it.
- Is that it?

311
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,283
Aren't you gonna slap me?

312
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:47,152
I've slept with men for a lot less,
trust me.

313
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,753
What happened to "Never
in a thousand years"?

314
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,590
That was negotiating.

315
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,601
So...

316
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,830
...deal?

317
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,576
Deal.

318
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,615
We got 150,000 here, John.

319
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,883
With Vittorio's place in solanos,
we'll be able to live off the interest.

320
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:22,717
Where's your father?

321
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,760
Everything all right, boss?

322
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:36,874
Yeah.
Let's get this over with...

323
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:41,169
...so I can get back to my family.

324
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,542
She'll get it done.

325
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:45,546
Nika and I have come too far together.

326
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,550
When money's on the line, trust no one.
- Sometimes you have to.

327
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,915
Not if you wanna survive,
you don't.

328
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:54,320
You really don't trust anyone,
do you?

329
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,523
Can you blame me after
all that's happened?

330
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:01,763
No, I mean before that.
Before prison.

331
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,798
Every time I trusted someone I got burned.

332
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,166
Every time I got close to someone,
I got screwed.

333
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,641
I know better and so should you.

334
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,369
That's right,
the Lotus Motel,

335
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:19,280
I don't know the number.
I can't talk anymore, I have to go.

336
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:33,891
Well, check it, I know this might
be a little forward and all, but...

337
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:36,158
Let me ask you something.

338
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,094
You got a man?

339
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,628
I mean,
a boyfriend?

340
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:44,366
No, what am I thinking? You're Mormon...
- I'm not Mormon.

341
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:48,074
You think all giris from Utah are Mormons?

342
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,341
They are,
aren't they?

343
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:58,612
Well, yo.
Hey, then you can party, right? Hey.

344
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,559
When I land, I want 12 armed agents
waiting for me on the ground.

345
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,025
Tell them I wanna go to the
motel from the airstrip.

346
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,424
You got it.

347
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,133
I was an ass before.
I apologize.

348
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,297
A little bit.

349
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,970
Sorry.
Here you go.

350
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,976
I was a huge ass.
I apologize.

351
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,512
I'm not gonna argue with you.

352
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:27,948
Well, what are the odds that
you're actually a doctor?

353
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,447
Fair enough.
They're probably not good, but...

354
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:38,587
And I should not have interrupted you,
and I'm sorry.

355
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,857
I'm sorry too.
- Well, then, apologies accepted.

356
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:45,594
I recommend the blueberry pie.

357
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:47,828
Blueberry pie it is.

358
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:08,025
Hey there, Danny.
- Hey.

359
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:13,193
Sure was nice of your daddy to
buy me a room for the night.

360
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,560
Yeah, he's always helping
out with vets and stuff.

361
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:16,928
Yeah.

362
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,532
Good man.

363
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:24,269
But I was wishing we could've
kept going on toward Utah.

364
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,137
Lots of light left in the day,
lots of road to go.

365
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,838
When Dad's back acts up we stop.

366
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:35,718
"Young Miss"?

367
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,447
That's kind of insulting,
isn't it?

368
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,681
I mean,
you're a grown woman.

369
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:48,128
But adults are always trying
to infantilize giris your age.

370
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,199
Treat you like children.

371
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,900
No duh. My dad won't let me get earrings,
and I'm 14.

372
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,767
You see,
that's what I'm saying.

373
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,036
You are more than perfectly capable
of making your own decisions.

374
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:03,578
Tell my dad that.
- Yeah, but he don't wanna hear it, right?

375
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:08,515
Because he wants to keep you as a baby.

376
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:16,951
Right? Even though you're more
than old enough to choose...

377
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,426
...how you wanna dress...

378
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:22,589
...or accessorize.

379
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,033
What are you doing?
- In need of a friend...

380
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,536
No, no. I'm telling my dad.
- You know, I'm not good at kid...

381
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,231
Wait!

382
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,774
She's got it all wrong.

383
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,715
Wait outside.

384
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,588
You and I are gonna work this out.

385
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:59,203
Jerry, you really don't want to do this.

386
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,867
The thing I like about you
is your determination.

387
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,843
I have a family in Kladno that
have been waiting for me...

388
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,982
...to send for them.

389
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,584
They know what kind of work you're in?

390
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:19,217
They think I work at starbucks.

391
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:29,327
How stupid do you think I am?

392
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,677
My daddy always said,
"Fool me once, shame on you...

393
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:44,178
...fool me twice,
and I put you in the ground."

394
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,642
Any more games and I stop
the whore's air, understand?

395
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:57,191
Thanks for the dance,
sweet pea.

396
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,728
You bitch.

397
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,363
Fooled you.

398
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:17,412
I carried it.
The cons can change it.

399
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,985
Oh, you really suck, Bellick,
you know that?

400
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,382
Roll him.
Let's go.

401
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,660
Hands behind your back.

402
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,527
Thank you.

403
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,362
You're as stupid as the prison doc,
you know that?

404
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:39,969
Ignore him.
- He conned her too.

405
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:42,197
Made her think he loved her.
Look what she got.

406
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:45,365
An overdose and a shot at 30 years inside.

407
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,141
What are you talking about?

408
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,011
You haven't been reading the papers,
have you, college boy?

409
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:58,178
Cops found your girlfriend fish-belly white,
gargling her own puke.

410
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,156
Shut up.
- What do you care?

411
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,794
As long as she left the door open for you.
- Shut up!

412
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,862
Hit a sore spot,
didn't I?

413
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,703
Dad?

414
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,854
It really is, like,
the best pie I ever had.

415
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,592
Do you know what it needs, though?

416
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,289
Some crack.

417
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,026
No, I mean, you know,
not a lot. A pinch.

418
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,796
A pinch of crack?
- A pinch of crack.

419
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,474
A pinch of crack,
a dollop of smack.

420
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,473
That's good pie.
- That's so wrong.

421
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,176
No?

422
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,808
Okay.

423
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:07,815
Hello?
- Sara, It's me,

424
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,421
What do you want?

425
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:12,658
I don't have time to talk.

426
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,462
There's every chance they're
listening to this call right now.

427
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:19,159
But there's a lot I want to say,

428
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,929
Please don't hang up on me.

429
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,768
I don't wanna talk to you.
- I heard about...

430
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,645
I heard about what happened.

431
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,181
I want you to know...

432
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:39,153
I want you to know how sorry I am.
For everything.

433
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,851
Sorry's not gonna do me a whole lot of
good with what I'm up against right now.

434
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,392
Listen,

435
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:50,400
Anyone with any ties to me and
my brother is in danger now.

436
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:53,628
I have no ties to you and
your brother anymore.

437
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,701
There is a way I can protect you.

438
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,036
It's already in your possessión.

439
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:06,343
What are you talking about?
- It was real, sara, you and me.

440
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,482
It's real.

441
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:14,983
Michael?

442
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,719
Michael?

443
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,503
How long to the motel?
- Approximately 10 minutes, sir.

444
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,539
Let's make it five.

445
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:42,047
Yo, I haven't taken a
shower like that in forever.

446
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:44,921
Where are you going?

447
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,717
I was gonna surprise you.
- Surprise me how?

448
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,057
I was gonna get some tequila and limes.

449
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:54,324
All right, well, hold up. I'll...
- No, no, no. It'll only take a minute.

450
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,558
Stay here and relax.

451
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,395
You seem kind of nervous.

452
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,800
I do?
- Yeah, you're sweating.

453
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,138
Well, maybe I am nervous.

454
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:07,243
Trust me, girl,
you got nothing to worry about, all right?

455
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:11,781
I'm one of the good guys.
- You seem like it.

456
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,615
Hang on tight.

457
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,655
I had the manager unlock the door.
- Got it.

458
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,328
If you're looking for the rat, John...

459
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:40,065
...Fibonacci's 2000 miles from here.

460
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,235
Who are you?

461
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,505
Local cops or feds?

462
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,978
Feds, John. Only roll out the
best for a man of your stature.

463
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,816
I deserve to know who turned on me.

464
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:03,989
Tommy?
- The man was facing a RICo rap.

465
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,822
He did not want to go to prison.

466
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,756
I'm sure you can appreciate that...

467
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,401
...knowing what you know
about the place now.

468
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:17,036
Whatever you're thinking
about doing, John, don't.

469
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,806
You are going back to Fox River today,
or the morgue.

470
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,415
That's your call.

471
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,551
I'm coming out.

472
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,023
Weapons come out first, John.

473
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,794
Forgive me.

474
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:47,393
Yeah, I'm coming out.

475
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:53,941
Easy, John.
Easy.

476
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,072
He's got a weapon. Right hand.
- These are serious men here.

477
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,541
They have instructions to shoot
at the first sign of aggressión.

478
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,313
Please, I'm asking you respectfully.

479
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:09,484
Drop the weapon, kneel,
and put your hands on your head.

480
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,387
I kneel only to God.

481
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,128
I don't see him here.

482
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,306
No!

483
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,198
I think I screwed up,

484
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:59,070
My dad's an Air Force colonel.
Total Nazi.

485
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:02,474
One of those nightmare,
overprotective dads.

486
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,707
Yeah?
- Well, I called him.

487
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,345
Told him I was traveling with you.

488
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:14,116
Told him that we were staying
in the same hotel room.

489
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,688
Girl.
- What?

490
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:21,297
You gotta learn how to lie.
What were you thinking?

491
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:25,128
I don't know... Yeah,
for some reason I don't know how.

492
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,437
He was mad enough when I told him I
was staying in a hotel room with a guy.

493
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,165
That was one thing.
- Yeah, yeah.

494
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,333
When I told him I was staying in a hotel...

495
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:39,973
...with a guy that I maybe sort of liked,
he lost it.

496
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:46,246
Wait.
Wait, what?

497
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,358
Is that okay?

498
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,131
At least let us take you into town.

499
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:10,707
No. If I'm seen with you
it's a lot of trouble for me.

500
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,746
I can walk.
It's only a mile.

501
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,351
We never would've made
it this far without you.

502
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:19,686
But now you're crossing
the border without me.

503
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,920
You can't go where we're going.

504
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,116
It's not a life for you.

505
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:30,165
Then that's it, then.

506
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,526
It's over for good.

507
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,294
Thank you.

508
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,436
Be safe.

509
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,440
Good luck.

510
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,993
I loved you, Michael.

511
00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:00,555
And I thought I was gonna get that back,
but you just used me.

512
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,795
That's not true.
- I deserve more than this.

513
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:07,759
I deserve more than just being the girl
that you call when you need something.

514
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,332
You think you're gonna
find the money in Utah?

515
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,999
I don't care about the money in Utah.

516
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:16,506
I don't want any more crime.

517
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,583
I turn you in, I get $200,000.
Legal money.

518
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,154
You're the policeman's problem now.

519
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:32,659
Nika.
- Don't come any closer or I'll shoot you.

520
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:34,856
No, you won't.

521
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,391
Good luck to you.

522
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,884
Hey.
- Hey.

523
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:37,889
HQ called. They're asking why
you didn't intercept Abruzzi...

524
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,859
...when he was walking towards the motel.

525
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:43,964
The man was a mob boss.
The right move was to get him trapped.

526
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:47,433
They're saying the way you played it,
there was only one possible outcome.

527
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:52,235
HQ has a problem with the way I do it, they
can pick a gun and follow me next time.

528
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:02,476
Scofield always knew the
rat was the key to Abruzzi.

529
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,850
We just put it out on the
wire and Abruzzi bit.

530
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,197
Speaking of scofield...

531
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,162
...the crash was staged.

532
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,637
Pig blood.

533
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:31,344
Smart kid.

534
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:40,990
The problem with being that clever,
is that sooner or later...

535
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:43,422
...you end up getting too
clever for your own good.

536
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,399
Good night.

537
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,728
You have no idea what you're in for.
