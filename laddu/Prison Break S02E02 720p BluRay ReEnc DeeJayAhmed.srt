1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:03,766
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:05,734
What are the charges?
- Attempted murder.

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:09,033
He's also arraigned for the murder
of his mother and his stepfather,

4
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:12,337
Don't look at me like I'm some con.
You're as crooked as scoliosis.

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,070
I don't get caught.

6
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,014
This is as far as you go.

7
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,049
Come on, bro.
- You and I, we're not bros.

8
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:26,123
When were you planning on
telling us about the money?

9
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,987
What money?
- Five million dollars...

10
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,721
...that Westmoreland planted
in the desert in Utah.

11
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:34,133
I found steadman.
I'm with him now, Linc. He's alive.

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,892
What?
You found steadman?

13
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,696
Oh, my God.

14
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,968
My hand has been in that
box for hours now. It is dying.

15
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,444
I can promise you nothing.
- Story of my life.

16
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:52,045
And these?
- The keys to a car that's waiting for us.

17
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,982
A couple hundred yards.
- That a two-of-us or a five-of-us?

18
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,316
That's a two-of-us.
- We got company.

19
00:00:58,691 --> 00:00:59,919
How did he know?

20
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:04,723
It's only a matter of time before we know
everything that is in Scofield's head,

21
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,230
Where he plans to run to,
how he plans to get there,

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,630
So when the time comes
that he does get there,,,

23
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,236
...we'll be waiting for him.

24
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,900
Canadian and Mexican border
patrols have all the mug shots,

25
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,270
BORTAc's on high alert,

26
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:21,710
see if we can get the Mexican border
patrol to set up checkpoints 50 miles in.

27
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:24,816
The warden over at Fox River called,
asked to be kept in the loop,

28
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,646
What should I tell him?
- That he's no longer in it.

29
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,517
That info that you asked for is
on your desk when you get in.

30
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,180
Thank you,

31
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,894
What's the plan, man?

32
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,698
No bars on these doors.
Do what you like.

33
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,935
With what?

34
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,665
We're supposed to be in Mexico,
sipping on margaritas...

35
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,174
...waiting for the heat to dip.
That was the plan.

36
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:02,003
See? They just used us to dig, right?
We're gophers.

37
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,945
Where's Michael?
- He'll be here.

38
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,914
Okay.
You know what, sucre?

39
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,452
Maybe you and I should go and get that
$5 million, you know what I'm saying?

40
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:13,558
It's sitting there in Tooele, ready to get.
- You wanna stay, shut your mouth.

41
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,058
You've got one more time to touch me.
- Guys, chill.

42
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,696
What?
- Hey!

43
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,693
Relax.

44
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,539
Honey, are you sure
you packed everything?

45
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,950
Yummy.

46
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,867
Our photos are in the paper.
They're all over the news.

47
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,401
Yeah, and you didn't see that coming?

48
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:04,904
What's so funny?
- The two of you. Cracks me up.

49
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,478
Here's to amateur hour.

50
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,511
What do you say?
- Yeah, yuk it up, funnyman.

51
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,755
Last supper, boys.

52
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,492
This is the part where we say goodbye.

53
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,427
It's not much.

54
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,493
It's enough to get you started.

55
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,663
Hey...
- No.

56
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,808
I'm not telling you where Fibonacci is.
- Well, I didn't ask.

57
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:41,309
I only ask for a quarter for a phone call.

58
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,312
Make four.

59
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,149
Thank you.

60
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,883
I wonder what happened to the other guys.

61
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,885
They all had a head start.
Except for T-Bag.

62
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:57,018
Yeah, he was bleeding pretty bad.

63
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,794
Think he's dead?

64
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,307
Are you done?

65
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,377
No, I still have to clean it.
- But you're done?

66
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,309
Yes.

67
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,767
It's time to move,

68
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,998
We got everything we need.

69
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,736
Just a quick stop in Utah and
then we're off to Mexico.

70
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:50,141
L.J. Has a hearing today to determine
if he gets tried as an adult.

71
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,245
I can get him.

72
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,550
It's not the right time.
- When will it be?

73
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,213
After we go to Mexico.
After we're off the news.

74
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,154
They framed him for a double homicide.

75
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,022
Soon as he loses his hearing,
they're gonna ship him out.

76
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,063
So today in the courthouse is
my only chance to get him.

77
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,329
They took Veronica.
They're not gonna take my son.

78
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:10,992
I know.

79
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,467
I know.

80
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,700
I would never leave L.J. Behind.

81
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,943
But we can't do this now.
There's no plan in place.

82
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,144
Believe me,
I know that courthouse.

83
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,374
I've been there more times
than I can remember.

84
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,576
The person guarding him's the bailiff.
He carries Mace and a stick.

85
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,053
So you're gonna bum-rush the courthouse.
That's your plan.

86
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,756
Are you serious?
- Yeah.

87
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,618
Hey, y'all,
we're headed out, man.

88
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,066
Well, good luck to everyone.

89
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,634
Stay out of trouble.
- Yeah.

90
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,805
This is it, papi.

91
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,309
I hope you find the girl, buddy.
- She's all I have.

92
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,004
I'll die trying.

93
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,447
Good luck.
- Yeah, you be easy, man.

94
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,796
Maybe we'll see each other again.

95
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,527
You never know, Michael.

96
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,164
You never know.

97
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,690
Tell me everything you
know about the courthouse.

98
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,308
You get any sleep?
- Couple hours.

99
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,273
Eight of them.
I still can't believe it.

100
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:36,245
This is exhibit A why you don't let women
work in the military or the police force...

101
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,179
...especially inside a male prison.
Because look what you get.

102
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,946
Dr. Sweetcheeks leaves
the door open for scofield.

103
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,783
And here we are.
- Sounds like there's more to the escape...

104
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,653
If Tancredi doesn't leave
her office door unlocked...

105
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,660
...those eight dirtbags would
be in the sHU right now, okay?

106
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,196
Bottom line!
- Brad.

107
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,228
Any update?
- None.

108
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,802
They were last seen at
that cemetery in oswego.

109
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,836
We'll get them.
- They'll get them.

110
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,771
It's been handed to the FBI.
- Doesn't mean we can't work it.

111
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,274
It does, actually.

112
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,572
You and I have been pulled off the pursuit.
- Why?

113
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:12,013
We're going to find out shortly.
We have to report to DoC headquarters.

114
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,778
I will meet you there.
- Sir, we can get these guys.

115
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,422
Give me a couple more days and I swear I...
- Brad.

116
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,193
We've got to go.

117
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,270
No family with Patoshik?
Nothing?

118
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:45,645
Yeah. Until about four years ago,
when he killed them all.

119
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,982
Updated rap sheet on Apolskis.
Take a look when you get a chance.

120
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,974
You have to use the key that we
keep in the grill because that's...

121
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,307
Man, I'm so sorry.

122
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,174
It's my bad.
My bad, bro.

123
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,940
I'm sorry.

124
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,095
"Scott Kolbrenner."

125
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,212
It's this one here.

126
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,341
Don't touch the radio.

127
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,888
Yeah, hi. I'm with the Des Moines Herald,
I'm covering the L.J. Burrows hearing.

128
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,157
What time's that start today?

129
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,449
Come on.

130
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,210
Thank you. Three o'clock.
The hearing lasts a half-hour max.

131
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,619
He'll be taken down to Transport
Bay at 10 till to catch the 4:00 van.

132
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,122
So how do we get close to him?

133
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:11,059
Well, when I was locked up,
I had nothing to do except study the briefs.

134
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,165
Nick savrinn's bar number was
on the front page of every one.

135
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,595
We wanna talk to L.J., we...

136
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,929
We pose as one of his attorneys.
- Yeah.

137
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,939
Hogwash, That is absolute hogwash,

138
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,804
Please answer the question.

139
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,112
How was scofield able to have
exclusive access to you...

140
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,475
...pull a shank on you and
bind you to your chair?

141
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,140
The warden of the penitentiary.

142
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,344
I trusted him.

143
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,081
Obviously, he betrayed that trust.

144
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,153
Officer Bellick...

145
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:46,454
...is it true that almost all the inmates
who either escaped or tried to escape...

146
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,430
...worked in Prison Industries?
- That's right.

147
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,433
Why did these inmates
have so much time...

148
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,936
...to dig a hole in the floor
of the guards' room...

149
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,700
...while working Prison Industries?
- I can answer that.

150
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,470
If any of you have ever
worked a day in a prison...

151
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,307
...you would know since an
inmate gets 19 cents an hour...

152
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:05,814
...some are bound to drag their feet.

153
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,017
Officer Bellick...

154
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:13,215
...is it true you sold the right to run
Prison Industries to the highest bidder?

155
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,725
No. Who the hell told you that?
- This is unbelievable.

156
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:21,458
While we're wasting time in here, there
are eight escaped convicts out there...

157
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,076
Were you employed at Fox River as
a correctional officer, Mr. Geary?

158
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,309
Yep.
- Yeah...

159
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,752
...until he was fired for
shaking down inmates.

160
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,518
That'll be your last outburst, officer.

161
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,361
Were you aware of any
arrangement officer Bellick had...

162
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,362
...with any inmate
regarding Prison Industries?

163
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,090
Yeah, he sold it to John Abruzzi.

164
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,703
John Abruzzi,
who is one of the escaped convicts?

165
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,168
Yep.

166
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,274
We'll get other C.o.'s to
substantiate this if we have to...

167
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,275
...so I'm giving you one
chance to get in front of it.

168
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,914
Did you sell Prison
Industries to John Abruzzi?

169
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,414
Yes or no?

170
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:19,054
Yes. But at no time was I aware of...
- That'll be all, officer Bellick.

171
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,284
That will be all.

172
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:24,491
Warden, you and officer Bellick
can step out into the hallway.

173
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,325
We'll call for you when
we've reached a decisión.

174
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,352
I'm gonna get some coffee.

175
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,455
Well, I did my best under
the circumstances.

176
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,793
The good news, sir,
is you had the hand iced...

177
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:07,837
...so I was able to restore blood
flow and the bones are pinned.

178
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,976
However, I recommend you
get medical attention AsAP.

179
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:15,172
Meanwhile, some aspirin.
It'll help thin the blood and avoid clotting.

180
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,178
Antibiotics, some painkillers.

181
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,484
I usually tell the owner of
the dog, cat, whatever...

182
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,351
...to coat them with peanut
butter so they're easier to chew.

183
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,357
But obviously, in your case...
- You did one hell of a job, doc.

184
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,154
Well, thank you.

185
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,621
Well, it's okay for you to leave now.

186
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,630
Oh, I'm leaving.

187
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,502
And you're not.
- What?

188
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,333
You heard me.
- Look, sir, I haven't seen anything...

189
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,805
...and I won't tell anyone.

190
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:48,675
You know,
I fell for that bill of goods once before.

191
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,109
Never again.

192
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,384
Sir, I swear to God I will tell nobody.
- You would.

193
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,953
And I would die in prison.

194
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,619
Please, please, please.

195
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,360
Now, you did me a solid,
so I'm gonna return the favor.

196
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,962
This can go down
humanely if you don't fight.

197
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:19,543
But if you pull a stunt like that again,
it's gonna get inhumane right quick.

198
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:20,940
Your call.

199
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,240
But one way or another...

200
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,443
...I am putting you down, doc.

201
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,690
Lincoln Burrows Jr.?
- Yeah.

202
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,596
In here.
You got a visitor.

203
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,579
You must be L.J.

204
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,213
Agent Mahone, FBI.
Thank you.

205
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,117
Please.

206
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,725
I'm assuming you've heard.

207
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,527
Yeah.

208
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:18,266
I have to tell you,
what your dad and uncle pulled off...

209
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:23,241
Very impressive.
I've been doing this 14 years...

210
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:27,937
...and most escapes can be attributed
to dumb luck or brute force.

211
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,410
The level of planning and
sophistication that went into this one...

212
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,881
...and eight guys got out...

213
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,918
I really do,
professionally speaking...

214
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,082
...have a lot of admiration
for Lincoln and Michael.

215
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,653
Cool.
Now we're buddies.

216
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,761
What do you need?

217
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,396
Help me bring them in peacefully.

218
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,334
I don't know where they are.

219
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,669
I don't know where they're going.
- There's another way you can help.

220
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,074
How?
- Go on TV.

221
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:04,744
I can have a camera crew
down here in a half an hour.

222
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,789
You know what, man?
The murder charge they put on my dad...

223
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,120
...the two murder charges they put me...

224
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,695
...everything's been a setup,
coming from way up top.

225
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,599
So the fact that you work
for the government...

226
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,131
I got nothing to say.

227
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:36,104
I'll give you the same advice that you'd get
from the guy working at the deli downstairs.

228
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,579
Start thinking about yourself now.

229
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,719
In fact, the sooner the better,
because no one...

230
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,651
...not your father, L.J.,
not your uncle...

231
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,791
...is going to do your time.

232
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,625
And at 16 years old,
you're looking at a long stretch.

233
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,527
How much time you get,
where you serve it...

234
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,001
...who your cellmate might be.

235
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,531
You need to start thinking
about yourself now.

236
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,305
I want your dad, I want your uncle,
and I'm willing to deal.

237
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,210
Don't wait and let someone
else get the reward.

238
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,558
What's up?

239
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,033
Hey, man,
you look familiar.

240
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,838
Did you rush sig Ep last semester?

241
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,843
Sig what?
- Sig Ep.

242
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,543
No.
- Next in line.

243
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,716
Where to?

244
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,848
Utah.

245
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,639
How we doing here?

246
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,442
Nothing until tomorrow.

247
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,278
All right, yo,
I got 45 bucks.

248
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,611
How far will that get me?

249
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:36,258
Nick savrinn.
Bar number is 56437.

250
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,632
I got a call time with my client,
L.J. Burrows.

251
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,838
Hello.
- Know who this is?

252
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,837
Yeah.

253
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,744
Yeah, Nick savrinn.

254
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,248
How you holding up?

255
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,414
Doing what I can do.

256
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,145
How about you?

257
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,951
I'm worried about you.

258
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,423
I'm sorry about what you're going through.
- Thanks,

259
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:07,691
Word is after this hearing,
because of my dad being so high-profile...

260
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,929
...they're shipping me to an adult
facility in Kingman, Arizona.

261
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,835
Yeah, well,
hopefully that ain't gonna happen.

262
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,505
You hear from Veronica today?

263
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,369
She didn't show up.
They gave me some court-appointed clown.

264
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,850
No, I haven't heard from her.

265
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,782
Hey, this fed came by
and talked to me today.

266
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,944
Yeah?

267
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,887
He wanted me to help try in
getting my dad to turn himself in,

268
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,357
Well, knowing your dad,
I doubt that's gonna happen.

269
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,325
Listen up, L.J.,
this is real important.

270
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:43,334
All right.
- On the third, look out for otis Wright.

271
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:47,461
You got that? On the third,
look out for Otis Wright,

272
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,402
Until then,
keep your head up.

273
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,508
What?
- Just remember that,

274
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,736
I'm gonna do everything
I can to get you out.

275
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,174
Hey, Nick.

276
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,212
If you talk to my dad...

277
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,907
,,, tell him no matter what,
I love him,

278
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,956
Hey.
- Hey.

279
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:12,255
Did you get him?
- Let's do this.

280
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,690
We got one more stop.

281
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,139
There is a belief in my religion
which I know to be true...

282
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,408
...and it applies to everyone,
Hindu or not.

283
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:37,711
The acts we commit in this life
determine where we go in the next.

284
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:42,087
And he who commits evil can
never hope for eternal happiness.

285
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,528
Never been a goal of mine, doc.

286
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,097
I'm more a here-and-now type.

287
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,430
I'll tell you something I know is true.

288
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:57,974
The Indians here,
the tomahawk variety...

289
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,371
...some of them believe...

290
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,741
Well, used to believe,
before most of them were slaughtered.

291
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:08,716
That when a warrior kills another in battle...

292
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:14,223
...he absorbs that fallen warrior's spirit.

293
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,728
So this isn't the end for you, doc.

294
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,000
You're with me now.

295
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,997
And how are you doing this fine day?

296
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,574
I'm great.
How are you?

297
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:44,313
Couldn't be better.
Anything in particular I can help you find?

298
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,780
Just looking.
Thanks.

299
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,511
Well, if you need any assistance,
just give a holler.

300
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,441
How are we this fine day?
- Great.

301
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,279
Can I help you find anything?
- I'm good, thanks.

302
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,826
Hey, we gotta go.

303
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,461
I just need to pay up.
- Now.

304
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,229
How are you today, officer?

305
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,634
Yeah, they were right...

306
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:46,539
Well, they were right back here.

307
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,146
We can make it to the courthouse on foot.

308
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,946
You don't understand.
Everything is in that car.

309
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,248
Forget the damn car.
We don't have time.

310
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,890
Come on, man,
let's go.

311
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,108
Hi.
- Hi.

312
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:01,314
It is the finding of this panel,
Warden Pope...

313
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:05,217
...you'll be docked two weeks,
placed on three months' probation.

314
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,391
Officer Brad Bellick...

315
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,222
...will be terminated,
effective immediately.

316
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,188
Mr. Bellick, you can retrieve whatever
belongings you may have from Fox River.

317
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,857
That'll be all.

318
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:22,335
I've worked at Fox River
since I was 18 years old.

319
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,873
Being a C.o. Is my life.

320
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,540
And we appreciate that.

321
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,509
We could've saved a lot of time
if you would've just told us...

322
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,512
...that this was gonna be a railroad.

323
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:34,208
That'll be all.
- There is only one person responsible...

324
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,547
...for this escape.
His name is Michael scofield.

325
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,815
It's not officer Bellick.
It's not me!

326
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,824
But you need a fall guy, fine.

327
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,724
But you're not gonna be just
taking officer Bellick's job.

328
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,559
Because even though I am not
proud of many of his actions...

329
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,369
...it will be a cold day in hell when I
turn my back on one of my own men.

330
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,168
I quit.

331
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,370
That will be all.

332
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,941
If this thing doesn't work out and
you end up going back to Fox River...

333
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,311
...I ain't coming to get you.

334
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:11,251
I mean,
you are the brains and I am the brute.

335
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,490
Seriously, Michael,
you don't have to do this.

336
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,538
Let's go.

337
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,844
We're good.

338
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:13,045
You got a call from Nick savrinn
earlier today. What was that all about?

339
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,550
He's my attorney.
That's privileged.

340
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,087
That's odd, because Nick savrinn
was found dead in his apartment...

341
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,589
...an hour before that call came into you.

342
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,751
Listen up, L, J,, this is real important,
- All right,

343
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,695
On the third, look out for Otis Wright,
You got that?

344
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,427
For someone who's convinced
the government is capable...

345
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,562
...of so many underhanded things, you
sure are playing fast and loose with me.

346
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,504
What are you gonna do,
throw another fake murder charge on me?

347
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,270
Who's otis Wright?
- I have no idea.

348
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,904
I think you do. And if you don't tell me,
after you're convicted...

349
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:49,349
...I will be in that courtroom when you're
sentenced, and I will hang you out to dry.

350
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,920
Take it to the bank.

351
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:42,103
Yeah, put me in touch with the
prosecutor in the L.J. Burrows case.

352
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,738
I want a meeting.

353
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,744
On the third,
look out for Otis Wright,

354
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,618
Until then,
keep your head up,

355
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:11,458
Otis Wright,

356
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,968
Let's go.
- Hold on.

357
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,668
Move it.
- Hold on.

358
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,439
I'll escort the boy.

359
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:10,450
Otis Wright.
Otis elevator on the right.

360
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,419
What is he planning?

361
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,961
Keep it in the holster and no one gets hurt.

362
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,161
Keep it in the holster.

363
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,706
All right.
L.J., hit stop.

364
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:31,642
He's coming with us,
so just stay cool. Stay cool.

365
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,383
Hey, buddy,
give me his gun.

366
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,791
Hey, hey.

367
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,364
L.J., give me your hand.

368
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,829
Thattaboy.
Come on.

369
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,877
Hey, back off.
Back off. Back off.

370
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,039
You're not shooting anybody.
Neither are you.

371
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,117
Give yourself up and your kid can walk.

372
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:11,744
That's the only way he's getting
out of this place. It's the only way.

373
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,254
Dad.

374
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,517
Dad!

375
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,527
Dad, you gotta let me go.
- No.

376
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,462
Dad.

377
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,098
You gotta let me go.

378
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,880
Up there. Scofield is in the building.
Take him.

379
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:46,613
You guys, go. Cover that way.
Scofield and Burrows are in the building.

380
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,486
Come on.

381
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,425
Freeze!
- Don't move!

382
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,567
Truck.
- Stop or we will shoot.

383
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,432
Stop!

384
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,539
Two suspects heading south on Liberty.

385
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,556
Bradley?

386
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,457
Yeah, Ma?

387
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,666
What are you doing home so early?

388
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:05,127
Well, I had to take...

389
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:10,168
...my personal days, you know,
before they went away.

390
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:13,105
Shouldn't you be looking for the convicts?

391
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,041
Well, they got somebody
else doing that, Ma.

392
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,946
You okay?

393
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,418
I'm good.

394
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,619
Okay.

395
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,724
All right.

396
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,392
We should break a bottle of
champagne across its bow.

397
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:49,597
If you're intending to get this home
for your anniversary tonight...

398
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,106
...I wouldn't recommend it.
- No.

399
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,603
Listen, I want you to know, I...

400
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,806
Well, I feel very fortunate to have met you.

401
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,452
I'm breaking out.

402
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,556
And you're gonna make sure
my brother goes with me.

403
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:34,172
Thank you for calling AutoStar, Dr., Gudat,
Am I pronouncing that correctly?

404
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,978
Dead on.
- How can I help you today?

405
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,744
I need directions.

406
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:45,047
Where to, sir?
- Utah.

407
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,426
Excuse me.

408
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:00,831
I'm sorry.

409
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,233
Are you scott Kolbrenner?

410
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,070
I am, yeah.

411
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:08,740
You must be Debra Jean.

412
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:11,046
It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah, same here.

413
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:13,513
I was almost ready to
leave when you called.

414
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,912
No one else responded.

415
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:18,249
I guess there's not a lot of Utah
people out here. Are you from there?

416
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,019
No, I just,
you know...

417
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:25,026
I'm headed out there to
collect an inheritance.

418
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,426
My grandpa died.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

419
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,567
It's all right.
He went out with his boots on.

420
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,366
So where's your stuff?

421
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,631
I mailed it yesterday.

422
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,434
Mailed it?
I've never heard of that.

423
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:41,939
You don't wanna lug it around.
Plus, I got a boy who works for UPs.

424
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:44,274
So he hooked it up.

425
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,678
So you wanna bounce?

426
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,750
Okay.
I'm parked out front.

427
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,395
Bradley?

428
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,800
Yeah, Ma?

429
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:13,535
They just announced the rewards on the TV.

430
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,305
What reward?
- The convicts.

431
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,142
For the convicts.
The ones who escaped.

432
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:23,150
How much?
- A hundred thousand dollars apiece.

433
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,484
Three hundred thousand for the animal
who killed President Reynolds' brother.

434
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:30,422
Every whacko in the country's
gonna be after those bums now...

435
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,494
...wouldn't you say?

436
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,097
Police!

437
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:45,099
Step out of the vehicle with your hands up.

438
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,788
We gotta move.
- I can't.

439
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,028
Oh, my God.

440
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,036
I failed him.

441
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,713
I failed him.

442
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:38,728
I sure hope you packed a lunch.
It's gonna be a long ride to Arizona.

443
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,227
Move your ass.

444
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:12,023
Get men in all the area hospitals. Wherever
they are, one of them's bleeding good.

445
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:17,190
Which means they either
come to us or they die.
